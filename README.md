# BookGenreClassification

Book Genre Classification Based on Synopsis
==========================================
*AIT Fall 2021 Deep Learning Final Project*
--------------

Authors: Ayla Kurdak and Lanea Rohan

Abstract
--------
The goal of this project is to create a deep neural network in order to produce a list of genre tags from a book synopsis. The genres should correspond to the genre of the book the synopsis belongs to. The synopsis and genre tag data was collected from the **Blurb Genre Collection**, which you can find more about here: https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/blurb-genre-collection.html. 

Data
-----
As mentioned, we used the **Blurb Genre Collection** as our dataset. The dataset comes pre-divided into training, test and validation sets. The original dataset comes with a lot of extra information for each book entry - we pared it down to just the book synopsis and the list of genre tags. You can find the original datasets in the `\data` folder. To see our cleaned data, check in `\code\milestone1.ipynb`.
