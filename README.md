Authors: Ayla Kurdak and Lanea Rohan

Abstract
--------
The goal of this project is to create a deep neural network in order to produce a list of genre tags from a book synopsis. The genres should correspond to the genre of the book the synopsis belongs to. The synopsis and genre tag data was collected from the **Blurb Genre Collection**, which you can find more about here: https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/blurb-genre-collection.html.
