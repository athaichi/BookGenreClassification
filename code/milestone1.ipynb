Enter the dazzling world of Karen Marie Moning, whose acclaimed Highlander novels   have captivated readers, spanning the continents and the centuries, bringing ancient   Scotland vividly to life.  In a novel brimming with time-travel adventure and   sensual heat, the bestselling author of The Dark Highlander delivers a   love story that will hold you in thrall—and a hero you will most certainly never   forget. BEWARE: lethally seductive alpha male of immense strength,   do not look at him. Do not touch him. Do not be tempted. Do not be seduced. With   his long, black hair and dark, mesmerizing eyes, Adam Black is Trouble with a capital   T. Immortal, arrogant, and intensely sensual, he is the consummate seducer, free   to roam across time and continents in pursuit of his insatiable desires. That is,   until a curse strips him of his immortality and makes him invisible, a cruel fate   for so irresistible a man. With his very life at stake, Adam’s only hope for survival   is in the hands of the one woman who can actually see him. Enter law student Gabrielle   O’Callaghan, who is cursed with the ability to see both worlds: Mortal and Faery.   From the moment she lays eyes on this stunning male, Gabby is certain of one thing:   He could be her undoing. Thus begins a long, dangerous seduction. Because despite   his powerful strength and unquenchable hungers,  Adam refuses to take a woman by   force.  Instead, he will tease his way into Gabby’s bed and make her want him just   as he wants her.  Now, no matter how hard Gabby tries to avoid him, Adam is everywhere,   invisible to all but her—perched atop her office cubicle in too-tight jeans, whispering   softly from behind the stacks of the law library, stealing her breath away with his   knowing smile…all the while tempting her with the promise of unimaginable pleasure   in his arms.  But soon danger will intrude on this sensual dance.  For as Adam’s   quest to regain his immortality plunges them into a world of timeless magic and the   deadly politics of the Faery queen’s court, the price of surrender could be their   very lives. Unless they can thwart the conspiracy that threatens both mortal and   Faery realms…and give them a shot at a destiny few mortals ever know: glorious, wondrous,   endless love.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Romance</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Karen Marie Moning</author>\\n<published>Jul 26, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 384 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780440237563</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/116072/the-immortal-highlander-by-karen-marie-moning/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Anything would be better than doing summer school on a computer while his scientist dad is stationed at the South Pole. \\xa0 Boring lives up to its name until Brian and his cousin Nora have a fight, get lost, and discover a huge, wooden house in the forest. With balconies, turrets, and windows seemingly stuck on at random, it looks ready to fall over in the next stiff breeze. To the madcap, eccentric family that lives inside, it’s not just a home—it’s a castle.\\xa0 \\xa0 Suddenly, summer gets a lot more exciting. With their new friends, Brian and Nora tangle with giant wasps, sharp-tusked wild boars, and a crazed bureaucrat intent on bringing the dangerously dilapidated old house down with a wrecking ball. \\xa0 This funny, fantastical story will resonate with any reader who’s ever wished a little adventure would find them.“For boys and girls alike, this story sings.”—Blue Balliett, award-winning author of\\xa0Chasing Vermeer</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Children’s Middle Grade Action & Adventure Books</d2><d0>Children’s Books</d0><d1>Children’s Middle Grade Books</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Keir Graff</author>\\n<published>Jun 05, 2018 </published>\\n<page_num> 304 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781101996232</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/530533/the-matchstick-castle-by-keir-graff/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Life in Baghdad had become intolerable.  Silenced by a series of brutal beatings at the hands of the Ba’ath Party’s Secret Police and declared an “enemy of the state,” he faced certain death if he stayed. Nabeel had grown up in the late 1950s and early ’60s in a large and loving family, amid the domestic drama typical of Iraq’s new middle class, with his mother Sabria working as a seamstress to send all of her seven children to college. As his story unfolds, Nabeel meets his future wife and finds his poetic voice while he is a student.  But Saddam’s rise to power ushers in a new era of repression, imprisonment and betrayal from which few families will escape intact.  In this new climate of intimidation and random violence Iraqis live in fear and silence; yet Nabeel’s mother tells him “It is your duty to write.”  His poetry, a blend of myth and history, attacks the regime determined to silence him. As  Nabeel’s fame and influence as a poet grows, he is forced into hiding when the Party begins to dismantle the city’s infrastructure and impose power cuts and food rationing.  Two of his brothers are already in prison and a third is used as a human minesweeper on the frontline of the Iran-Iraq war.   After six months in hiding, Nabeel escapes with his wife and young son to Beirut, Paris, Prague, Budapest, and finally England.Written by Jo Tatchell, a journalist who has spent many years in the Middle East and who is a close friend of Nabeel Yasin’s, Nabeel’s Song is the gripping story of a family and its fateful encounter with history. From a warm, lighthearted look at the Yasin family before the Saddam dictatorship, to the tale of Nabeel’s persecution and daring flight, and the suspense-filled account of his family’s rebellion against Saddam’s regime, Nabeel’s Song is an intimate, illuminating, deeply human chronicle of a country and a culture devastated by political repression and war.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Fantasy</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Jo Tatchell</author>\\n<published>Jun 03, 2008 </published>\\n<page_num> 368 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780767926973</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176634/the-poet-of-baghdad-by-jo-tatchell/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

His stunning challenge to Lyndon Johnson in the 1968 New Hampshire primary inspired young liberals and was one of the greatest electoral upsets in American history. But the 1968 election ultimately brought Richard Nixon and the Republican Party to power, irrevocably shifting the country’s political landscape to the right for decades to come. Dominic Sandbrook traces one of the most remarkable and significant lives in postwar politics, a career marked by both courage and arrogance. Sandbrook draws on extensive new research – including interviews with McCarthy himself – to show convincingly how Eugene McCarthy’s political experience embodies the larger decline of American liberalism after World War II. These were tumultuous times in American politics, and Sandbrook vividly captures the drama and historical significance through his intimate portrait of a singularly interesting man at the heart of it all.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>U.S. History</d2><d3>20th Century U.S. History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Dominic Sandbrook</author>\\n<published>Apr 12, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 432 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781400077908</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/160351/eugene-mccarthy-by-dominic-sandbrook/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

As she mixes traditional and Western literary genres, Silko examines themes of memory, alienation, power, and identity; communicates Native American notions regarding time, nature, and spirituality; and explores how stories and storytelling shape people and communities. Storyteller illustrates how one can frame collective cultural identity in contemporary literary forms, as well as illuminates the importance of myth, oral tradition, and ritual in Silko’s own work.

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Thirteen Ways of Looking</title>\\n<body>NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY CHICAGO TRIBUNE AND ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review • NPR • Los Angeles Times •\\xa0The Boston Globe •\\xa0The Seattle Times • The IndependentIn such acclaimed novels as Let the Great World Spin and TransAtlantic, National Book Award–winning author Colum McCann has transfixed readers with his precision, tenderness, and authority. Now, in his first collection of short fiction in more than a decade, McCann charts the territory of chance, and the profound and intimate consequences of even our smallest moments. “As it was, it was like being set down in the best of poems, carried into a cold landscape, blindfolded, turned around, unblindfolded, forced, then, to invent new ways of seeing.” In the exuberant title novella, a retired judge reflects on his life’s work, unaware as he goes about his daily routines that this particular morning will be his last. In “Sh’khol,” a mother spending Christmas alone with her son confronts the unthinkable when he disappears while swimming off the coast near their home in Ireland. In “Treaty,” an elderly nun catches a snippet of a news report in which it is revealed that the man who once kidnapped and brutalized her is alive, masquerading as an agent of peace. And in “What Time Is It Now, Where You Are?” a writer constructs a story about a Marine in Afghanistan calling home on New Year’s Eve. Deeply personal, subtly subversive, at times harrowing, and indeed funny, yet also full of comfort, Thirteen Ways of Looking is a striking achievement. With unsurpassed empathy for his characters and their inner lives, Colum McCann forges from their stories a profound tribute to our search for meaning and grace. The collection is a rumination on the power of storytelling in a world where language and memory can sometimes falter, but in the end do not fail us, and a contemplation of the healing power of literature.Praise for Thirteen Ways of Looking“Extraordinary . . . incandescent.”—Chicago Tribune “The irreducible mystery of human experience ties this small collection together, and in each of these stories McCann explores that theme in some strikingly effective ways. . . . [The first story] is as fascinating as it is poignant. . . . [The second] captures the mundane and mysterious aspects of shaping characters from the gray clay of words, placing them in realistic settings and breathing life into their lungs. . . . That he makes the story so emotionally compelling is a sign of his genius. . . . The most remarkable [piece] is Sh’khol. . . . Caught in the rushing currents of this drama, you know you’re reading a little masterpiece.”—The Washington Post “McCann is a writer of power and subtlety and beauty. . . . The powerful title story loiters in the mind long after you’ve read it.”—Sarah Lyall, The New York Times “[McCann] unspools complex and unforgettable stories in this, his first collection in more than a decade.”—The Boston Globe “McCann is a passionate writer whose impulse is always toward a generous understanding of his diverse characters.”—The Wall Street Journal “Powerful, profound, and deeply empathetic, McCann’s beautifully wrought writing in Thirteen Ways of Looking glides off the page.”—BuzzFeed “McCann weaves the magic that made Let the Great World Spin so acclaimed.”—The Huffington PostFrom the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Colum McCann</author>\\n<published>Sep 20, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780812986587</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/240260/thirteen-ways-of-looking-by-colum-mccann/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

In Dark Banquet, zoologist Bill Schutt takes us on a fascinating voyage into the world of some of nature’s strangest creatures–the sanguivores. Using a sharp eye and mordant wit, Schutt makes a remarkably persuasive case that blood feeders, from bats to bedbugs, are as deserving of our curiosity as warmer and fuzzier species are–and that many of them are even worthy of conservation. Enlightening and alarming, Dark Banquet peers into a part of the natural world to which we are, through our blood, inextricably linked.\"Dark Banquet is an amazing account of all those creatures that most of us consider really creepy!

In his short life he proved to be one of the greatest and most original thinkers of the second generation of Romantic poets, with such poems as ‘Ode to a Nightingale’, ‘On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer’ and ‘La Belle Dame sans Merci’. While his writing is illuminated by his exaltation of the imagination and abounds with sensuous descriptions of nature’s beauty, it also explores profound philosophical questions.John Barnard’s acclaimed volume contains all the poems known to have been written by Keats, arranged by date of composition. The texts are lightly modernized and are complemented by extensive notes, a comprehensive introduction, an index of classical names, selected extracts from Keats’s letters and a number of pieces not widely available, including his annotations to Milton’s\\xa0Paradise Lost.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

And yet we are a sleep-sick society, ignorant of the facts of sleep–and the price of sleep deprivation. In this groundbreaking book, based on decades of study on the frontiers of sleep science, Dr. William Dement, founder and director of the Stanford University Sleep Research Center, explains what happens when we sleep, when we don’t, and how we can reclaim the most powerful–and underrated–health miracle of all. Taking us on a fascinating tour of our sleeping body and mind, Dr. Dement reveals the price we have paid for ignoring sleep–an epidemic of heart disease, 33 percent of traffic-fatigue-related accidents, and immeasurable mental and psychological disadvantages. And he offers a hands-on prescription for vibrant good health and longevity, including…self-tests to determine how much sleep you really need…the role of prescription and over-the-counter sleeping aids…the latest research on how sleep affects the immune system…how to combat insomnia, snoring, and jet lag…plus information on sleep disorder clinics nationwide, Web sites, and more.Taking readers on a fascinating tour of our sleeping body and mind, Dr. William C.

You were made for something much bigger. And no, you don’t have to be an astronaut, or even a Star Wars fan, to live it. Finding God in a Galaxy Far, Far Away is not about space travel, or even a movie. It’s about rediscovering your sense of wonder—something we adults have successfully squelched from our everyday lives. But God never meant it to be that way. Timothy Jones, by way of an astounding, eye-opening study of the spiritual parallels found in the Star Wars saga, will make you a kid again. You’ll be marveling at the mysterious, laughing anew at life’s “coincidences,” and remembering above all the Creator for which you were made. May the True Force Be with You  Remember when Star Wars first captured your imagination? How your longing for adventure propelled you to distant worlds and transformed you into a Jedi knight faster than you could say, “Luke, I am your father”?  This same longing, once sparked by John Williams’s triumphant score and fanned by Darth Vader’s sweeping black cape, is your ticket to life’s greatest adventure.  Join Timothy Paul Jones on an astounding, eye-opening exploration of the spiritual themes in the Star Wars saga and the truth will become clear: Like young Luke Skywalker, you were also made for more—much more.  Rediscover awe. Revel in the wonder of every moment. And pursue all you were meant to be. It is your destiny.    “The Force is strong with this one. I could not recommend it more.” Joshua Griffin, Editor/Owner, TheForce.Net Manager, Purpose Driven Youth Ministry “If you own a lightsaber—or a Bible—you’re sure to benefit from reading his book.”  Kevin Miller, author and reviewer  HollywoodJesus.com  “‘Awe-some’ reading that both delights and challenges us. A fun and thoughtful book for Christians who consider and enjoy popular culture and media.”  Robert W. Pazmino  Valeria Stone Professor of Christian Education, Andover Newton Theological School  Story Behind the Book“The night I first saw Star Wars from the backseat of my parents’ Ford Pinto was the first night I experienced awe. It sent me on a quest that continues today. There is, in every one of us, a longing to touch ‘the forever,’ to sense the magnitude of the vastness in which we live. This universal longing explains why we ride roller coasters and tell scary stories. This universal longing for awe also explains why, after nearly thirty years, the popularity of the Star Wars saga shows no sign of subsiding. I wrote this book to inspire readers to relish awe and wonder because God did not only create us to long for awe, but also to live in it!”  —Timothy Jones</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Timothy Paul Jones</author>\\n<published>Oct 03, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 192 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781590525777</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/88604/finding-god-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away-by-timothy-paul-jones/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

All she knew about her was that the baby had been born in Wuhu, a city in southern China, and left near a police station in her first three days of life.  Her birth mother had left a note with Lulu’s western and lunar birth dates. In 1999 Emily and her daughter–now a happy, fearless four-year-old–returned to China to find out more. That journey and its discoveries unfold in this lovely, touching and sensitively observed book.In Wuhu Diary, we follow Emily and LuLu through a country where children are doted on yet often summarily abandoned and where immense human friendliness can coexist with outbursts of state-orchestrated hostility–particularly after the U.

Collecting some of the most powerful passages from Pema Chödrön’s many beloved books, this compact handbook for spiritual practice is rich with inspiration and insight. Here she explores life-changing concepts, themes, and practices from the Buddhist tradition, showing how anyone (not just Buddhists) can draw from them to become more courageous, aware, and kindhearted. It includes the benefits of meditation and mindfulness, letting go of the fixations that weigh us down, working directly with fear and other painful emotions, and much more. With these teachings, Pema lays the groundwork for how we can start to overcome the habitual patterns that so often hinder compassion for ourselves and others—and that hold us back from embracing our lives joyfully and fearlessly. To anyone who ever wanted to experience true freedom, these teachings are a shining light on the path.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d2>Personal Growth</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1><d1>Self-Improvement</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Pema Chodron</author>\\n<published>Mar 27, 2018 </published>\\n<page_num> 152 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781611805956</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/27306/comfortable-with-uncertainty-by-pema-chodron/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

In Being Perfect, Ann Quindlen gives a name to, and invites us to laugh at, a lifestyle that is all too familiar to many people, one that emphasizes the pursuit of trying to be perfect in the eyes of others, and to win the world’s good opinion, rather than focusing on the most important goal of all: \"Giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself.\"  With wit and wisdom, Quindlen offers a keen understanding of how to create a life that is rich in meaning for you, by living on your own terms and by listening to your own deepest instincts, rather than to the demands and values of the world outside.  This audiobook is an inspiring guide to living a rewarding and happy life, a life fulfilling in all its flaws, a life that is truly yours.In A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen reflects on what it takes to \"get a life\"–to live deeply every day and form your own unique self, rather than merely to exist through your days.  \"Knowledge of our own mortality is the greatest gift God ever gives us,\" Quindlen states, \"because unless you know the clock is ticking, it is so easy to waste our days, our lives.\"  Her mother died when Quindlen was nineteen: \"It was the dividing line between seeing the world in black and white, and in Technicolor.  The lights came on for the darkest possible reason I learned something about enduring, in a very short period of time, about life.  And that was that it was glorious, and that you had no business taking it for granted.\"  In A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen guides us with an understanding that comes from knowing how to see the view, the richness in living.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d2>Inspiration & Motivation</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Anna Quindlen</author>\\n<published>Apr 26, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 60 Minutes</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780739317938</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/136817/being-perfect-and-a-short-guide-to-a-happy-life-by-anna-quindlen/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

But Ralph Nickleby proves both hard-hearted and unscrupulous, and Nicholas finds himself forced to make his own way in the world. His adventures gave Dickens the opportunity to portray an extraordinary gallery of rogues and eccentrics: Wackford Squeers, the tyrannical headmaster of Dotheboys Hall, a school for unwanted boys, the slow-witted orphan Smike, rescued by Nicholas, the pretentious Mantalinis and the gloriously theatrical Mr and Mrs Crummels and their daughter, the ‘infant phenomenon’. Like many of Dickens’s novels, Nicholas Nickleby is characterised by his outrage at cruelty and social injustice, but it is also a flamboyantly exuberant work, whose loose, haphazard progress harks back to the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding.  In his introduction Mark Ford compares Nicholas Nickleby to eighteenth-century picaresque novels, and examines Dickens’s criticism of the ‘Yorkshire schools’, his social satire and use of language. This edition includes the original illustrations by ‘Phiz’, Dickens’s original preface to the work, a chronology and a list of further reading. \\xa0For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It is the contention of Raubolt and his contributors that these practices instill fear and foster blind obedience to the favored proclivities of the leaders of the training institute. In turn, this subservience, which seeps into the therapeutic relationship, prevents both the training candidates and their prospective patients from developing creative, authentic, and meaningful experiences.This is a book written from the perspective of scholars and experienced clinicians who are acutely aware both on a personal and theoretical level of the disruptive role of power games in psychoanalytic institutes. The collection features a highly nuanced and comprehensively developed psychoanalytic understanding of the use and misuse of power, authority, status, and control operating in many traditional and nontraditional training experiences. Finally, new supervisory and training models based on empathy, respect for subjective experiences, and democratic principles are proposed as an alternative to the abusive practices so powerfully described in this book.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Psychology</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Richard Raubolt</author>\\n<published>Nov 17, 2006 </published>\\n<page_num> 320 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781590511732</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/139320/power-games-by-richard-raubolt/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Judy Batalion grew up in a house filled with endless piles of junk and layers of crumbs and dust; suffocated by tuna fish cans, old papers and magazines, swivel chairs, tea bags, clocks, cameras, printers, VHS tapes, ballpoint pens…obsessively gathered and stored by her hoarder mother. The first chance she had, she escaped the clutter to create a new identity—one made of order, regimen, and clean white walls. Until, one day, she found herself enmeshed in life’s biggest chaos: motherhood. Confronted with the daunting task of raising a daughter after her own dysfunctional childhood, Judy reflected on not only her own upbringing but the lives of her mother and grandmother, Jewish Polish immigrants who had escaped the Holocaust. What she discovered astonished her. The women in her family, despite their differences, were even more closely connected than she ever knew—from her grandmother Zelda to her daughter of the same name. And, despite the hardships of her own mother-daughter relationship, it was that bond that was slowly healing her old wounds. Told with heartbreaking honesty and humor, this is Judy’s poignant account of her trials negotiating the messiness of motherhood and the indelible marks that mothers and daughters make on each other’s lives.From the Trade Paperback edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Parenting</d1><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Self-Improvement</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Judy Batalion</author>\\n<published>Jan 05, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 352 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780698183681</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317373/white-walls-by-judy-batalion/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>The Grammar of God</title>\\n<body>For readers of Bruce Feiler’s Walking the Bible and Kathleen Norris’s The Cloister Walk comes a powerful exploration of the Bible in translation. Aviya Kushner grew up in a Hebrew-speaking family, reading the Bible in the original Hebrew and debating its meaning over the dinner table. She knew much of it by heart—and was therefore surprised when, while getting her MFA at the University of Iowa, she took the novelist Marilynne Robinson’s class on the Old Testament and discovered she barely recognized the text she thought she knew so well. From differences in the Ten Commandments to a less ambiguous reading of the creation story to a new emphasis on the topic of slavery, the English translation often felt like another book entirely from the one she had grown up with. Kushner began discussing the experience with Robinson, who became a mentor, and her interest in the differences between the ancient language and the modern one gradually became an obsession. She began what became a ten-year project of reading different versions of the Hebrew Bible in English and traveling the world in the footsteps of the great biblical translators, trying to understand what compelled them to take on a lifetime project that was often considered heretical and in some cases resulted in their deaths. In this eye-opening chronicle, Kushner tells the story of her vibrant relationship to the Bible, and along the way illustrates how the differences in translation affect our understanding of our culture’s most important written work. A fascinating look at language and the beliefs we hold most dear, The Grammar of God is also a moving tale about leaving home and returning to it, both literally and through reading.Praise for The Grammar of God “The highest praise for a book, perhaps, is tucking it into a slot on your bookshelf where you’ll always be able to effortlessly slide it out, lay it across your lap and soak it up for a minute or a long afternoon’s absorption. The Grammar of God: A Journey into the Words and Worlds of the Bible, Aviya Kushner’s poetic and powerful plumbing of both the Hebrew and English translations of the Bible, now rests in just such an easy-to-grab spot in my library. In a word, it’s brilliant. And beautiful.”—Barbara Mahany, Chicago Tribune“Aviya Kushner has written a passionate, illuminating essay about meaning itself. The Grammar of God is also a unique personal narrative, a family story with the Bible and its languages as central characters.”—Robert Pinsky “Kushner is principally interested in the meanings and translations of key Biblical passages, and she pursues this interest with a fierce passion. . . . A paean, in a way, to the rigors and frustrations—and ultimate joys—of trying to comprehend the unfathomable.”—Kirkus Reviews “A remarkable and passionately original book of meditation, exegesis, and memoir. In Kushner’s redemptive vision, the Bible in its many translations is a Noah’s ark, and her book, too, does a work of saving. When I put it down, I wept.”—Rosanna Warren, author of Stained Glass “What a glorious book! From Sarah’s laughter to the idea of Jewish law being a dialogue and not a rigid set of rules, this is a book not only to learn from but to savor.”—Peter Orner, author of Love and Shame and Love “In this splendid book, each page is a wonder.”—Willis Barnstone, author of The Restored New Testament</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Aviya Kushner</author>\\n<published>Sep 08, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780385520829</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/96379/the-grammar-of-god-by-aviya-kushner/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

A challenge that could help redeem his life–if he doesn’t lose it first. A private investigator, kayak adventurer, and whale watching tour guide who specializes in salvage operations based out of an old, purple church, Jake Rikker is caught off guard by the request of his new client. Up-and-coming jewelry designer Elise St. Dennis wants him to find not a valuable object, but the menacing ex-con who has traced her to the small town of Fog Point. Elise is desperate and afraid to go to the police. So, seeing the job as an opportunity to take his focus off his divorce and his relationship with his estranged daughters, Jake throws himself into helping someone who clearly needs him. The fact that Elise is pretty, vulnerable, and unattached doesn’t hurt either. Aided by his business partner, May–a crusty widow–Jake sets out in pursuit of the stalker.

But this is my story, and it has a beginning, a middle, and an end….”The Open Door is a luminous and profoundly moving novel inspired by the life of Constance Fenimore Woolson, one of the most widely-read and respected American authors of the nineteenth century. Exploring themes of passion, life, death, friendship, and art, the novel is a vivid evocation of the complex forces behind literary creation.After years of supporting her mother and a hapless brother through her writing, Constance finds herself in early middle age “hungry, ravenous to see and live as much as possible.” She sails for Europe with a letter of introduction to Henry James, the writer she admires above all others. Constance is intoxicated by Europe, Italy in particular, and she and James eventually meet in Florence. James is delighted by this highly intelligent, independent woman (whom he dubs “Fenimore” as a sign of his esteem) and makes her his confidante. For her part, Constance finds with James “the unequalled joy of never running out of things to say.”Constance’s courageous, open nature is odds with James’s more secretive one and inevitably leads to friction, transgression, and revenge both private and public. Elegantly conceived and life-affirming, The Open Door is an unforgettable portrait of a remarkable woman who lived with passion and refused to accept the narrowing of her world.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Elizabeth Maguire</author>\\n<published>Jun 10, 2008 </published>\\n<page_num> 248 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781590512838</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/106108/the-open-door-by-elizabeth-maguire/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Annotated Ancient Mariner</title>\\n<body>Coleridge’s greatest work, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is utterly unique, unlike any other ballad. No narrative poem has rivaled it in combining scenes of terror with scenes of incomparable beauty. Although enormously popular in the nineteenth century, it is seldom read or studied today. This annotated version by Martin Gardner will help to renew the appreciation and deepen the understanding of Coleridge’s unjustly neglected masterpiece.Preceding the poem is a biographical sketch of the great poet, which emphasizes those aspects of his many-sided life and personality that have the strongest bearing on the poem, especially on circumstances surrounding its composition. Both the 1798 and 1834 versions of the poem are presented, with notes on words, lines, and stanzas that Coleridge later excised. Following the poem, Gardner summarizes major critical attitudes toward the ballad, discusses possible higher levels of meaning, and closes with questions concerning the poem’s much-debated moral.Many artists have illustrated the Rime, but none as skillfully as Gustave Doré. He was far and away the most popular and prolific book illustrator of all time, and though his work has been out of fashion for some time, it is becoming harder and harder to dismiss him as a mere yeoman illustrator.Here is your chance to read, or reread, Coleridge’s classic Rime, to fully understand it, and to relish Doré’s magnificent illustrations.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Poetry</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</author>\\n<published>Sep 01, 2003 </published>\\n<page_num> 210 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781591021254</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/230636/annotated-ancient-mariner-by-samuel-taylor-coleridge/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Her warmth, humor, and brilliant smile made her one of the most popular women on television, with millions of viewers following her on the small screen each week. Yet her success masked a tumultuous personal story and a harrowing private life. For the first time, Baxter is ready to share her incredible highs, (working with Robert Redford, Doris Day, Lana Turner, and the cast of Family Ties), and lows (a thorny relationship with her mother, a difficult marriage to David Birney, a bout with breast cancer), finally revealing the woman behind the image.From her childhood in Hollywood, growing up the daughter of actress and co-creator of One Day at a Time Whitney Blake, Baxter became familiar with the ups and downs of show business from an early age. After wholeheartedly embracing the 60s counterculture lifestyle, she was forced to rely on her acting skills after her first divorce left her a 22-year-old single mother of two. Baxter began her professional career with supporting roles in the critically panned horror film Ben, and in the political thriller All the President’s Men.More lucrative work soon followed on the small screen. Baxter starred with actor David Birney as the title characters in controversial sitcom Bridget Loves Bernie. While the series only lasted a year, her high-profile romance with Birney lasted 15 volatile and unhappy years. Hiding the worst of her situation from even those closest to her, Baxter’s career flourished as her self-esteem and family crumbled. Her successful run as Nancy on Family was followed by her enormously popular role on Family Ties, and dozens of well-received television movies.After a bitter divorce and custody battle with Birney, Baxter increasingly relied on alcohol as a refuge, and here speaks candidly of her decision to take her last drink in 1990. And while another ruinous divorce to screenwriter Michael Blodgett taxed Baxter’s strength and confidence, she has emerged from her experiences with the renewed self-assurance, poise, and understanding that have enabled her to find a loving, respectful relationship with Nancy Locke, and to speak about it openly.Told with insight, wit, and disarming frankness, Untied is the eye-opening and inspiring life of an actress, a woman, and a mother who has come into her own.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Performing Arts</d2><d2>Film</d2><d2>Arts & Entertainment Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Meredith Baxter</author>\\n<published>Mar 06, 2012 </published>\\n<page_num> 320 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307719317</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/205033/untied-by-meredith-baxter/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

The Bayard College hockey team isn’t where Jacob Flass thought he’d be a season ago. He was a rising star in the Canadian major junior league, cruising toward a spot on an NHL roster—until a single disastrous night on the town brought it all crashing down. Now he’s out of options, except for playing well, studying hard, and staying away from the opposite sex. He’s not supposed to be flirting with the most intriguing woman he’s ever met. But how could he possibly stay away? Skylar Lynwood’s freshman year of college was a disaster. This semester she’s working hard to get back to the grades her parents want to see, and she’s dealing with her painful memories by doing volunteer work.

The book focuses on the understanding that a deep awareness of our shared desire to avoid pain leads to an awareness of our responsibility to relieve others of suffering. Worlds in Harmony offers the reader insight into the relation between awareness and right action, and bridges personal consciousness and global concerns. With the knowledge that insight is of no use unless it results in action, the Dalai Lama teaches ways of being, thinking, and acting in the world that are based on equanimity and understanding.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>His Holiness The Dalai Lama</author>\\n<published>Nov 09, 2004 </published>\\n<page_num> 160 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781888375817</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546428/worlds-in-harmony-by-hh-the-dalai-lama-foreword-by-daniel-goleman/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

An unnamed narrator recounts a simple anecdote, his sighting of the Union  Jack—the British Flag—during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, in the few days preceding  the uprising’s brutal repression by the Soviet army. In the telling, partly a digressive  meditation on “the absurd order of chance,” he recalls his youthful self, and the  epiphanies of his intellectual and spiritual awakening—an awakening to a kind of  radical subjectivity. In his Nobel address Kertesz remembered:  “I, on a lovely spring  day in 1955, suddenly came to the realization that there exists only one reality,  and that is me, my own life, this fragile gift bestowed for an uncertain time, which  had been seized, expropriated by alien forces, and circumscribed, marked up, branded—and  which I had to take back from ‘History’, this dreadful Moloch, because it was mine  and mine alone…”The Contemporary Art of the Novella series is designed to highlight work by major authors from around the world. In most instances, as with Imre Kertész, it showcases work never before published; in others, books are reprised that should never have gone out of print. It is intended that the series feature many well-known authors and some exciting new discoveries. And as with the original series, The Art of the Novella, each book is a beautifully packaged and inexpensive volume meant to celebrate the form and its practitioners.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Imre Kertész</author>\\n<published>Jan 19, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 80 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781933633879</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/198600/the-union-jack-by-imre-kertesz/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

According to the Mahamudra view, confusion arises as wisdom when we realize that everything we experience is the radiance of the mind’s own nature. And what is the nature of our mind? And how do we come to recognize that? These are the questions Gampopa answers for his students in the text commented upon here, known as the Great Community Talks. He shows them—and now us—the path of deep understanding and meditation that leads to the realization of Mahamudra, the “Great Seal” of the true nature of reality.  Gampopa was a\\xa0 twelfth-century Buddhist monk who was a disciple of Tibet’s greatest yogi, Milarepa. He applied Milarepa’s instructions on meditation to reach the highest realization of Mahamudra. In this volume of advanced teachings, Gampopa passes on these same instructions in the form of heart advice on how to practice the nature of mind and reach enlightenment.  Ringu Tulku’s commentary on the text, taken from his own community talks to students in Europe and America, makes Gampopa’s teaching\\xa0 wonderfully accessible. His gentleness, warmth, and humor, as well as his wisdom and practicality, shine through in his own heartfelt advice on how we too could transform confusion into wisdom.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ringu Tulku</author>\\n<published>Sep 11, 2012 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781590309957</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/218250/confusion-arises-as-wisdom-by-ringu-tulku/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

With their broad canvas and large cast of fictional and historical characters, the novels in this series present a panorama of the American political and imperial experience as interpreted by one of its most worldly, knowing, and ironic observers.The centennial of the United States was celebrated with great fanfare–fireworks, exhibitions, pious calls to patriotism, and perhaps the most underhanded political machination in the country’s history: the theft of the presidency from Samuel Tilden in favor of Rutherford B. Hayes. This was the Gilded Age, when robber barons held the purse strings of the nation, and the party in power was determined to stay in power. Gore Vidal’s 1876 gives us the news of the day through the eyes of Charlie Schuyler, who has returned from exile to regain a lost fortune and arrange a marriage into New York society for his widowed daughter. And although Tammany Hall has faltered and Boss Tweed has fled, the effects of corruption reach deep, even into Schuyler’s own family.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Gore Vidal</author>\\n<published>Feb 15, 2000 </published>\\n<page_num> 384 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780375708725</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/183779/1876-by-gore-vidal/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

May Sinclair’s finest novel stands comparison with the work of Willa Cather, Katherine Mansfield, and the young Virginia Woolf.As a child, Mary Olivier’s dreamy disposition and fierce intelligence set her apart from her Victorian family, especially her mother, \"Little Mamma,\" whose dazzling looks cannot hide her meager love for her only daughter. Mary grows up in a world of her own, a solitude that leaves her free to explore her deepest passions, for literature and philosophy, for the austere beauties of England’s north country, even as she continues to attend to her family.

The real problem is the government’s well-meaning but misguided attempt to reduce the payoffs for success. \\xa0Four years ago, Edward Conard wrote a controversial bestseller, Unintended Consequences, which set the record straight on the financial crisis of 2008 and explained why U.S. growth was accelerating relative to other high-wage economies. He warned that loose monetary policy would produce neither growth nor inflation, that expansionary fiscal policy would have no lasting benefit on growth in the aftermath of the crisis, and that ill-advised attempts to rein in banking based on misplaced blame would slow an already weak recovery. Unfortunately, he was right. \\xa0Now he’s back with another provocative argument: that our current obsession with income inequality is misguided and will only slow growth further. \\xa0Using fact-based logic, Conard tracks the implications of an economy now constrained by both its capacity for risk-taking and by a shortage of properly trained talent—rather than by labor or capital, as was the case historically. He uses this fresh perspective to challenge the conclusions of liberal economists like Larry Summers and Joseph Stiglitz and the myths of “crony capitalism” more broadly. \\xa0Instead, he argues that the growing wealth of most successful Americans is not to blame for the stagnating incomes of the middle and working classes. If anything, the success of the 1 percent has put upward pressure on employment and wages.\\xa0Conard argues that high payoffs for success motivate talent to get the training and take the risks that gradually loosen the constraints to growth. Well-meaning attempts to decrease inequality through redistribution dull these incentives, gradually hurting not just the 1 percent but everyone else as well. \\xa0Conard outlines a plan for growing middle- and working-class wages in an economy with a near infinite supply of labor that is shifting from capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-intensive, innovation-driven fields. He urges us to stop blaming the success of the 1 percent for slow wage growth and embrace the upside of inequality: faster growth and greater prosperity for everyone.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Economics</d2><d2>Management</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>Business</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Edward Conard</author>\\n<published>Sep 13, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 320 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781595231239</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318965/the-upside-of-inequality-by-edward-conard/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

But the dramatic human story of the extraordinary projection of Spanish might in the second half of the sixteenth century has never been fully told—until now. In World Without End, Hugh Thomas chronicles the lives, loves, conflicts, and conquests of the complex men and women who carved up the Americas for the glory of Spain. \\xa0 Chief among them is the towering figure of King Philip II, the cultivated Spanish monarch whom a contemporary once called “the arbiter of the world.” Cheerful and pious, he inherited vast authority from his father, Emperor Charles V, but nevertheless felt himself unworthy to wield it. His forty-two-year reign changed the face of the globe forever. Alongside Philip we find the entitled descendants of New Spain’s original explorers—men who, like their king, came into possession of land they never conquered and wielded supremacy they never sought. Here too are the Roman Catholic religious leaders of the Americas, whose internecine struggles created possibilities that the emerging Jesuit order was well-positioned to fill. \\xa0 With the sublime stories of arms and armadas, kings and conquistadors come tales of the ridiculous: the opulent parties of New Spain’s wealthy hedonists and the unexpected movement to encourage Philip II to conquer China. Finally, Hugh Thomas unearths the first indictments of imperial Spain’s labor rights abuses in the Americas—and the early attempts by its more enlightened rulers and planters to address them. \\xa0 Written in the brisk, flowing narrative style that has come to define Hugh Thomas’s work, the final volume of this acclaimed trilogy stands alone as a history of an empire making the transition from conquest to inheritance—a history that Thomas reveals through the fascinating lives of the people who made it.Praise for World Without End \\xa0“Readers will not find a more reliable guide to the maturing Spanish Empire. . . . World Without End reminds us that the far-flung Spanish Empire was the work of many minds and hands, and by the end their myriad stories carry a cumulative charge.”—The New York Times Book Review“A sweeping, encyclopedic history of the arrogance, ambition, and ideology that fueled the quest for empire.”—Kirkus Reviews \\xa0 “Literary power is a vital part of a great historian’s armoury. As in his earlier books, Thomas demonstrates here that he has this in abundance.”—Financial Times \\xa0 “A vivid climax to Hugh Thomas’s three-volume history of imperial Spain.”—The Telegraph  \\xa0 “Thomas clearly excels in the Spanish history of religion, politics, and culture, [and] successfully shows that Spain’s global ambition knew no bounds.”—Publishers WeeklyFrom the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>World History</d2><d2>Military History</d2><d3>European World History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Hugh Thomas</author>\\n<published>Aug 11, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 496 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780812998122</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/249788/world-without-end-by-hugh-thomas/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Here mercs and smugglers, gangsters and warriors fight toe to toe, side by side, and behind each other’s backs in the backwaters of a universe ripped apart by war.On Zelos II a man and a woman are held prisoner in a dark cell, each fighting in their own way for survival at the hands of Imperial captors—and a chance for escape that could cost one of them their life. On the tortured landscape of Ryloth, Fenig Nabon awaits a ship of women warriors to complete a dangerous deal: the smuggling of a troupe of dancers to the homeworld of the Hutts—only to get more than she bargained for.

In the era of questionable Internet “facts” and parental oversharing, it’s more important than ever to find credible information on everything from prenatal vitamins to screen time. The good news is that parents and parents-to-be no longer need to rely on an opinionated mother-in-law about whether it’s OK to eat sushi in your third trimester, an old college roommate for sleep-training “rules,” or an online parenting group about how long you should breastfeed (there’s a vehement group for every opinion). Credible scientific studies are out there – and they’re “bottom-lined” in this book. The ultimate resource for today’s science-minded generation, The Informed Parent was written for readers who prefer facts to “friendly advice,” and who prefer to make up their own minds, based on the latest findings as well as their own personal preferences. Science writers and parents themselves, authors Tara Haelle and Emily Willingham have sifted through thousands of research studies on dozens of essential topics, and distill them in this essential and engaging book.

The revelation of her womanhood marks the beginning of her journey through a succession of changing identities—including son, wife, warrior, and mother—each of which brings its own special wisdom, but none of which, she discovers, can ultimately define her. In the course of her adventurous life, Grey deals with all the challenges of her tumultuous age—from political oppression to corrupt Church hierarchy to the horrors of the Black Death—ultimately finding peace and a kind of redemption by embracing the beautifully impermanent quality of identity that her unusual life has enabled her to understand.

Today, at the age of 51, after three trials and with no parole in sight, Leslie has become a remarkable survivor of a living nightmare. This work presents the first in-depth look at how this “girl-next-door” became one of Manson’s “girls.” It also tells about Karlene Faith’s thirty-year friendship with Leslie, whom she met while teaching in prison. To everyone who encountered Leslie – including prison staff and television journalists – she was not the demon typically portrayed by the media, but rather a gentle, generous spirit who mourned her victims. But why didn’t this intelligent young woman see the evil in the “messiah” who had sexually exploited her, preached a racist ideology, and ordered her to murder? Faith pieces together the puzzle, starting with Leslie’s spiritual quest within the sixties counterculture and her immediate attraction to Manson during a chance meeting. We learn of Manson’s ability to look into her mind and commiserate with her turmoil. We also see his own need to control women and how his brainwashing techniques enabled his followers to embrace him as God, giving them little choice but to obey. Leslie’s journey out of Manson’s grasp is a riveting feminist and spiritual story of recovering one’s self. Why this rehabilitated woman, long punished for one man’s madness, has not been able to leave prison is another story Faith brings to light. Filled with accounts of political injustices, this powerful book moves the reader to rethink the meanings and limits of guilt and punishment.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Karlene Faith</author>\\n<published>Jun 14, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 431 Minutes</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781524709631</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/547261/the-long-prison-journey-of-leslie-van-houten-by-karlene-faith/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Heroic</title>\\n<body>Often problematically labeled as “Brutalist” architecture, the concrete buildings that transformed Boston during 1960s and 1970s were conceived with progressive-minded intentions by some of the world’s most influential designers, including Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier, I. M. Pei, Henry Cobb, Araldo Cossutta, Gerhard Kallmann and Michael McKinnell, Paul Rudolph, Josep Lluís Sert, and The Architects Collaborative.  \\xa0 As a worldwide phenomenon, building with concrete represents one of the major architectural movements of the postwar years, but in Boston it was deployed in more numerous and diverse civic, cultural, and academic projects than in any other major U.S. city. After decades of stagnation and corrupt leadership, public investment in Boston in the 1960s catalyzed enormous growth, resulting in a generation of bold buildings that shared a vocabulary of concrete modernism. The period from the 1960 arrival of Edward J. Logue as the powerful and often controversial director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority to the reopening of Quincy Market in 1976 saw Boston as an urban laboratory for the exploration of concrete’s structural and sculptural qualities. What emerged was a vision for the city’s widespread revitalization often referred to as the “New Boston.”  \\xa0 Today, when concrete buildings across the nation are in danger of insensitive renovation or demolition, Heroic presents the concrete structures that defined Boston during this remarkable period—from the well-known (Boston City Hall, New England Aquarium, and cornerstones of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University) to the already lost (Mary Otis Stevens and Thomas F. McNulty’s concrete Lincoln House and Studio; Sert, Jackson &amp; Associates’ Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School)—with hundreds of images; essays by architectural historians Joan Ockman, Lizabeth Cohen, Keith N. Morgan, and Douglass Shand-Tucci; and interviews with a number of the architects themselves. The product of 8 years of research and advocacy, Heroic surveys the intentions and aspirations of this period and considers anew its legacies—both troubled and inspired.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Mark Pasnik, Chris Grimley, Michael Kubo</author>\\n<published>Oct 27, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 336 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781580934244</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/250692/heroic-by-mark-pasnik-chris-grimley-and-michael-kubo/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Rabbi Paul</title>\\n<body>A brilliant new biography of Saint Paul, whose interpretations of the life and teachings of Jesus transformed a loosely organized, grassroots peasant movement into the structured religion we know todayWithout Paul, there would be no Christianity. His letters to various churches scattered throughout the Roman Empire articulated, for the first time, the beliefs that make up the heart of Christian practice and faith. In this extraordinary biography, Bruce Chilton explains the changing images of Paul, from the early Church period when he was regarded as the premiere apostle who separated Christianity from Judaism to more recent liberal evaluations, which paint him as an antifeminist, homophobic figure more dedicated to doctrine than to spiritual freedom. By illuminating Paul’s thoughts and contributions within the context of his time, Chilton restores him to his place as the founding architect of the Church and one of the most important figures in Western history. Rabbi Paul is at once a compelling, highly readable biography and a window on how Jesus’ message was transformed into a religion embraced by millions around the world. Drawing on Paul’s own writings as well as historical and scholarly documents about his life and times, Chilton portrays an all-too-human saint who helped to create both the most beautiful and the most troublesome aspects of the Church. He shows that Paul sought to specify the correct approach to such central concerns as sexuality, obedience, faith, conscience, and spirit, to define religion as an institution, and to clarify the nature of the religious personality—issues that Christians still struggle with today.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Bruce Chilton</author>\\n<published>Nov 15, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 354 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780385508636</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/27173/rabbi-paul-by-bruce-chilton/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Most companies think they already have such a plan-but often they really have only a budget, a sales goal, or an excuse.  What’s the solution? According to Paul Kurnit and Steve Lance, it’s not about copying someone else’s cookie-cutter plan, or retreading your own plan from years past. There’s a far more effective option: harnessing the company’s own internal brain trust to create something fresh and perfectly tailored.  The authors show how to maximize collaboration among all key players in marketing, R&amp;D, research, sales, financial, legal, and senior management. When everyone combines their knowledge, the critical elements become clear, including brand positioning, target audience, and competitive strategy.  Filled with easy-to-follow advice for businesses large and small, The Little Blue Book of Marketing is a powerful tool in a small package.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Marketing</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Business</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Paul Kurnit, Steve Lance</author>\\n<published>Dec 31, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781591843054</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304817/the-little-blue-book-of-marketing-by-paul-kurnit/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Wanton destruction in the name of progress—particularly in the decades immediately following World War II—resulted in a legacy forever lost, a cultural heritage destroyed by the wrecker’s ball. By reminding us of things lost, James Goode’s magisterial and poignant study represented a comprehensive call for action, a mandate for responsible stewardship of the architectural legacy of Washington, DC. Both the familiar public Washington of official landmarks and the private city of residential neighborhoods are paid tribute in this volume, dedicated to the vanished.At once a visual delight, a fascinating social history, and an eloquent appeal for ongoing awareness, Capital Losses reveals the Washington that was and how it became what it is today.

Smart Change explores the psychological mechanisms that form and maintain habits in individuals and groups and offers real, accessible and actionable advice for changing habits. In an engaging narrative, Markman covers a wide range of habits, from individual behaviors like eating better and exercising regularly to work-related behaviors such as learning effectively and influencing customers’ purchases. He proposes that there are five effective tools to help individuals change behavior and to help people influence the habits of the people around them:1. Tame the “Go” system: Identify the triggers of habits, replace old behaviors with new ones and generate specific plans to deal with obstacles.2. Harness the “Stop” system: Learn to deal with stress and other factors that hinder the development of new and positive habits.3. Optimize your goals. Determine the course of behavior change and how to successfully incorporate those changes for the long term.4. Manage your environment: Change your surroundings to dramatically reduce poor behavior and habits.5. Engage your Neighbors: To affect other people’s behavior, understand the shared culture that creates a mutual dependency, and allows neighbors and colleagues to have a profound positive influence on the behavior of other members of their community.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Psychology</d1><d1>Self-Improvement</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Art Markman, PhD</author>\\n<published>Jan 06, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780399164125</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313621/smart-change-by-art-markman-phd/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

But help it with what? In Colombia and the U.S. Mario Murillo explores the misdirected and devastating impact that U.S. military “aid” continues to have on the war torn-people of Colombia. Beginning with a brief history of Colombia, Murillo analyzes the complex forces driving Colombia’s current decades-old guerilla war, U.S. involvement, media perceptions, and possible paths to peace. Whether it has been the U.S.-led war against “drug trafficking,” the newly constituted “war against terrorism,” or, as we have seen over the last two years, a convenient marriage of the two, the main effect has been to allow the U.S. to further expand its role in Colombia. The foundations of Colombia’s social, political, and military conflict are rarely addressed by U.S. policy. Murillo describes Colombia’s history of institutionalized corruption, state neglect, far-reaching poverty, and political violence and how they precede by decades the introduction and expansion of the drug trade.Colombia and the U.S. argues that the conflict in Colombia is not about drugs, nor guerrillas, nor “terrorism,” but rather about the unwillingness of the country’s elite to open up spaces for truly democratic participation in areas of economic and social development and political representation.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>World History</d2><d2>World Politics</d2><d3>Latin American World History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Mario A.

The personalities behind every burst of 1960s liberal reform – from civil rights and immigration reform, to Medicare and Head Start.LBJ’s towering political skills and his ambitious slate of liberal legislation are the stuff of legend: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, and environmental reform. But what happened after the bills passed? One man could not and did not go it alone. Joshua Zeitz reanimates the creative and contentious atmosphere inside Johnson’s White House as a talented and energetic group of advisers made LBJ’s vision a reality. They desegregated public and private institutions throughout one third of the United States; built Medicare and Medicaid from the ground up in one year; launched federal funding for public education; provided food support for millions of poor children and adults; and launched public television and radio, all in the space of five years, even as Vietnam strained the administration’s credibility and budget.Bill Moyers, Jack Valenti, Joe Califano, Harry McPherson and the other staff members who comprised LBJ’s inner circle were men as pragmatic and ambitious as Johnson, equally skilled in the art of accumulating power or throwing a sharp elbow. Building the Great Society is the story of how one of the most competent White House staffs in American history – serving one of the most complicated presidents ever to occupy the Oval Office –  fundamentally changed everyday life for millions of citizens and forged a legacy of compassionate and interventionist government.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Domestic Politics</d2><d2>Political Figure Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d2>U.S. History</d2><d3>20th Century U.S. History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Joshua Zeitz</author>\\n<published>Jan 30, 2018 </published>\\n<page_num> 400 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780525428787</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317976/building-the-great-society-by-joshua-zeitz/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Noel Coward called him “the most talented man in America.” Apt descriptions, indeed, for Allen is not only a comedian, but a prolific writer, composer, pianist, actor, and a serious thinker as well. Those who are familiar with Steve Allen only in his capacity as a comedian may find it surprising that he has produced a collection of thought-provoking observations on a variety of serious topics in his new book, Reflections. But anyone familiar with his two-volume study of the Scriptures – Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion, and Morality – or his incisive critique of America’s declining intellectual standards – “Dumbth”: And 81 Ways to Make Americans Smarter – will realize that Allen’s serious side is at least as creative and interesting as his flights of comedic fancy.Steve Allen is, for the most part, a self-taught intellectual. Perhaps this is the reason that he is able to write in a casual but clear, non-academic style, which makes even his weightiest ideas accessible to the average reader. And as befits a professional humorist, Allen displays his considerable wit from time to time in these pages. But by and large, his comments on assorted philosophical, political, and social questions are not only serious but challenging. No matter what issue he addresses – aging, happiness, heroes, justice, love, psychology, religion, sex, or TV – the popular humorist-and-philosopher-in-one always finds something fresh and insightful to say.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Classics</d0><d1>Literary Collections</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Steve Allen</author>\\n<published>Sep 01, 1994 </published>\\n<page_num> 326 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780879759049</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/229734/reflections-by-steve-allen/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Born into a prominent New York family (she was the niece of Edith Wharton), Farrand eschewed the traditional social life of the Gilded Age to pursue her passion for landscape and plants. Many of her clients were members of the highest echelon of society with estates in Newport, the Berkshires, and Maine, but Farrand ultimately became a consultant for university campuses, including Yale and Princeton, and for public gardens, including the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden and the Rose Garden at The New York Botanical Garden. Perhaps her best-known work is the extensive garden at Dumbarton Oaks, originally a private residence and now a research institute of Harvard University.Deeply influenced by the English landscape designer Gertrude Jekyll, Farrand was known for broad expanses of lawn with deep swaths of borders planted in a subtle palette of foliage and flowers. Her gardens have been photographed at their peak especially for this book, and these lush illustrations are complemented by beautiful watercolor wash renderings of her designs, now preserved at the library of the University of California at Berkeley.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Home & Garden</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Crafts, Home & Garden</d1><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Judith B.

Sometimes it seems like you are speaking completely different languages. Cognitive neuroscientist Dr. Dawna Markova and communication expert Angie McArthur\\xa0have spent years developing and implementing tools to help people find common ground. In Reconcilable Differences, they provide the strategies you need to bridge the gap at the heart of your differences with others. Each of us possesses rational intelligence: the capacity to divide information into discrete categories, processes, and logical steps. But you may not realize that the secret to building bridges between people lies hidden in your relational intelligence: the way you communicate, understand, learn, and trust. Reconcilable Differences shows you how to map mind patterns (the secret to pinpointing communication pitfalls) and identify thinking talents (the catalysts for peak performance). You will gain insights into how you learn in order to turn doubt into trust and uncertainty into productive engagement. Brimming with anecdotes and advice not only from the authors’ files but also from their own experiences as a mother- and daughter-in-law who are like night and day,\\xa0Reconcilable Differences\\xa0is your guidebook for making profoundly positive change with those you care about.Advance praise for Reconcilable Differences “Reconcilable Differences offers an inspiring way to bridge differences with someone you care about.

He made contact with the Coast Guard, the Air Force, Lloyd’s of London, and many other agencies. He obtained microfilm copies of newspapers from cities where various incidents had been reported.This exhaustive research had an unexpected result – it solved the mystery. It also resulted in the publication of The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved, which is now back in print.Larry Kusche’s book is more than an investigation of a mystery; it is a fascinating case history of a “manufactured mystery” in the making.

Determined to speak out more actively for both Holocaust survivors and the disenfranchised everywhere, he sets himself a challenge: \"I will become militant. I will teach, share, bear witness. I will reveal and try to mitigate the victims’ solitude.\" He makes words his weapon, and in these pages we relive with him his unstinting battles. We see him meet with world leaders and travel to regions ruled by war, dictatorship, racism, and exclusion in order to engage the most pressing issues of the day. We see him in the Soviet Union defending persecuted Jews and dissidents; in South Africa battling apartheid and supporting Mandela’s ascension; in Cambodia and in Bosnia, calling on the world to face the atrocities; in refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia as an emissary for President Clinton. He chastises Ronald Reagan for his visit to the German military cemetery at Bitburg. He supports Lech Walesa but challenges some of his views. He confronts Francois Mitterrand over the misrepresentation of his activities in Vichy France. He does battle with Holocaust deniers. He joins tens of thousands of young Austrians demonstrating against renascent fascism in their country. He receives the Nobel Peace Prize. Through it all, Wiesel remains deeply involved with his beloved Israel, its leaders and its people, and laments its internal conflicts. He recounts the behind-the-scenes events that led to the establishment of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. He shares the feelings evoked by his return to Auschwitz, by his recollections of Yitzhak Rabin, and by his memories of his own vanished family. This is the magnificent finale of a historic memoir.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>World History</d2><d2>Literary Figure Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d2>Arts & Entertainment Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d3>European World History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Elie Wiesel</author>\\n<published>Sep 01, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 448 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307764096</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/190332/and-the-sea-is-never-full-by-elie-wiesel/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

His three children, snatched from him in a cruel accident, were everything he worked for and loved. But one day, he enters a crowded market and sees a bird, caged and frightened and sick. With very little money in his pocket, he waits until the vendor is closing up. Quickly, Noor Nobi bargains and, happy to get anything for the sickly thing, the vendor accepts his offer. For some reason Noor Nobi cannot explain, it is important for him to nurse the bird back to health. When it is finally able to fly, Noor Nobi takes his bird to a big Banyan tree and releases it. Only then is he able to weep and fully grieve for his children.Before Noor Nobi knows it, he is back at work and taking his weekly earnings to the market where he continues to buy, heal, and free as many birds as he can. Crowds gather; some laugh and say he is crazy, some stand reverently, some don’t know what to think. But Noor Nobi’s kindness saves a growing number of birds, and the birds, in turn, give him new purpose. Author Veronika Martenova Charles read a short newspaper article about the “Birdman” of Calcutta and her imagination took flight. She traveled to India, found Noor Nobi, and witnessed the freeing of the birds for herself. The Birdman is a touching, true story, tenderly illustrated by Annouchka Gravel Galouchko and Stéphan Daigle. It is accompanied by an afterword, diary entries, and photographs of the author’s experience.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Children’s Books</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Veronika Martenova Charles</author>\\n<published>Sep 12, 2006 </published>\\n<page_num> 32 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780887767401</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/26306/the-birdman-by-veronika-m-charles-illustrated-by-annouchka-g-galouchko-and-stephan-daigle/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Though part of a legacy of time-traveling sisters, Lilia Sinclair is planted firmly in twenty-first-century Edinburgh. Her granny’s matchmaking with thirteenth-century Highlanders isn’t about to lure her into the past, especially as ancient Scotland enters troubled times. After all, Lilia is blessed—or cursed—with dire prophetic visions. To protect herself, she’s put up an icy emotional wall no man could cross—until a pair of gorgeous, rippling arms breaks right through. Graham MacTavish is pure trouble. Once the dragon bound to Loch Ness, he’s transformed into a philanderer of the first order. In fact, because of his dalliances with other men’s wives, a rival clan wants his head on a pike. Before he provokes an all-out war, Graham is banished to the twenty-first century, where he must win Lilia’s hand—or return to die. But after meeting a lass as fierce as any Highland warrior, Graham knows one thing: life with Lilia, in any century, is a fate to embrace.Praise for My Seductive Highlander“Ms. Greyson pens a masterpiece of visions, kilted passions, and humor to cast a spell of\\xa0utter delight\\xa0over her readers.

Robin Layton, as I would have expected, has  turned this staple of Americana into a gorgeous art form.”—George Vecsey, The New York Times “This book provides such inspiration.  With just a ball  and hoop you are on your way to fulfilling your dreams.  Robin Layton  illustrates the magic and purity of our game with her amazing photos.”—Gary Payton, Basketball Hall of FamerFrom urban playgrounds to small-town alleyways and windswept barnyards,  basketball is a universal American experience and worldwide cultural  touchstone. Renowned photojournalist Robin Layton captures that shared  community, as well as the diversity and astonishing beauty surrounding  this simple iron ring in hoop: the american dream, a loving look at basketball at its most elemental level: the basketball hoop. hoop includes approximately  100 stunning photographs of a wide variety of American hoops, from  humble garage and street courts around the country to the open-air White  House court. Layton’s photographs offer a breathtaking view of the  weathered dreams, fading memories, and future glories hanging from  solitary backboards around the country. Layton’s hoops include the childhood baskets of celebrated players such as Shaquille O’Neal, Larry Bird, LeBron James, Sue Bird,  and more documenting the altars upon which they laid their dreams,  honed their skills, and made a first splash in the game.  Robin has  photographed basketball shrines such as New York’s Rucker Park  playground and tiny Milan High (the real-life underdog school that  inspired the movie Hoosiers). Many of the large-format images are  accompanied by personal quotes from coaches and players, past and  present, about the game of basketball and the significance of particular  hoops in their lives, notably Mike Krzyzewski, Robin Roberts, Gary Payton, Danny Manning, and Rebecca Lobo among others.hoop: the american dream is  not just another book about basketball, nor is it another roundup of  action photos. It is an artful portrait of an American institution and a  poignant vision of an American landscape for anyone passionate about  the sport. This book is dedicated to Pat Summitt and the Boy &amp; Girls  Clubs of America.“Robin Layton, through her photography, quite literally achieves the goal of capturing the essence of the game.”—Hannah Storm, ESPN “Robin Layton brings us a beautiful, pebble-grained  planet—basketball in all its settings, from schoolyard to barnyard to  graveyard.

In these uncertain times, former-Pinkerton-detective-turned-bestselling-author Jake Donovan is beckoned home to Manhattan. He has made good money as the creator of dashing gumshoe Blackie Doyle, but the price of success was Laura Wilson, the woman he left behind. Now a Broadway star, Laura is engaged to a millionaire banker—and waltzing into a dangerous trap. \\xa0 Before Jake can win Laura back, he’s nearly killed—and his former partner is shot dead—after a visit to the Yankee Club, a speakeasy dive in their old Queens neighborhood. Suddenly Jake and Laura are plunged into a conspiracy that runs afoul of gangsters, sweeping from New York’s private clubs to the halls of corporate power and to the White House itself. Brushing shoulders with the likes of Dashiell Hammett, Cole Porter, and Babe Ruth, Jake struggles to expose an inconspicuous organization hidden in plain sight, one determined to undermine the president and change the country forever.Praise for The Yankee Club \\xa0 “Glittering with a hint of Nick and Nora, Michael Murphy’s 1930s Manhattan provides a witty setting for murder and mayhem.”—Mary Daheim, bestselling author of The Alpine Yeoman</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Cozy Mysteries</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Mystery & Suspense</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Michael Murphy</author>\\n<published>Aug 12, 2014 </published>\\n<page_num> 280 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780804179317</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/237075/the-yankee-club-by-michael-murphy/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Writing with an unerring sense of suspense and of history experienced firsthand, James Webb takes us on a myth-shattering cultural odyssey deep into the heart of contemporary Vietnam, with a riveting thriller that tells a love story — love for those who perished, for family and friends, and between a soldier and the land where he had always been ready to die.Brandon Condley survived five years of combat as a U.S. Marine only to lose the woman he loved to an enemy assassin. Now he is back in Vietnam, working to recover the remains of unknown American soldiers. On a routine mission, Condley finds a body that doesn’t match its dog tags — a body that propels him into a vortex of violence and intrigue where past and present become one.As the mystery of the dead man unravels, a link is revealed to two well-known killers: “Salt and Pepper,” a pair of treasonous Americans who led a deadly Viet Cong ambush against Condley’s own men. Galvanized by a fresh trail to these long-lost deserters, Condley has finally found a purpose: Under the auspices of his government job, he is going to hunt down the traitors. On his own, he is going to kill them.Condley’s hunt cannot be kept secret from his former enemies, or his friends. And in the shadows that linger from Vietnam’s long season of darkness and terror, he has no way of knowing which side is more dangerous. Surrounding him is an unforgettable cast of characters: Dzung, Condley’s closest friend, a South Vietnamese war hero who might have led his country if his side had won the war, now reduced to driving a cyclo as his family starves in Saigon’s District Four. Colonel Pham, a battle-hardened Viet Cong soldier who lost three children to American bombs. Manh, a cutthroat Interior Ministry official who blackmails Dzung into a mission of murder. The Russian soldier Anatolie Petrushinsky, who left his soul in Vietnam as his empire collapsed around him. And the beautiful Van, Colonel Pham’s daughter, who spurns the scars of war as she pursues her dreams of freedom. As Condley stalks his elusive prey across old battlefields and throughout Eurasia, returning always to the brooding streets of Saigon, his mission — and the odds of his surviving it — grow more precarious with each step he takes toward the truth.Lost Soldiers captures the Vietnam of past and present — its beauty and squalor, its politics and people. Propelled by a page-turning mystery, shot through with adventure and intrigue, it irrevocably transforms our view of that haunted land and brings us as complete an understanding as we will ever have of what happened after the war — and why. No writer today is more qualified to take us into that world than James Webb.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Suspense & Thriller</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Mystery & Suspense</d1><d1>Military Fiction</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>James Webb</author>\\n<published>Aug 27, 2002 </published>\\n<page_num> 464 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780440240914</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/187706/lost-soldiers-by-james-webb/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Through debut illustrator Jia Liu’s bright, playful collage artwork, readers can imagine what it would be like to have a tongue like a sword, like a straw, or like a party blower, among many other silly and illuminating comparisons.

An indispensable introduction to a trilogy wrought with action, imagination, and mystery, The Dire Earth is sure to thrill new readers and diehard fans alike. \\xa0 In the middle of the twenty-third century, an inexplicable disease engulfs the globe, leaving a trail of madness and savagery in its wake. Dutch air force pilot Skyler Luiken discovers he is immune to the disease when he returns from a mission to find the world in chaos, but he soon realizes that he’s not the only one to have endured the apocalypse. Elsewhere, the roguish Skadz, the cunning Nigel, and the tough-as-nails Samantha each make their way toward the last remaining bastion of sanity: Darwin, Australia, home to a mysterious alien artifact that may hold the key to the survival of the human race. \\xa0 Praise for The Darwin Elevator \\xa0 “A hell of a fun book.”—James S.

In her clingy dresses and dangling earrings she exuded a sexuality at odds with the innocence projected by the unicorn posters on her walls.  While her  embittered mother fretted about her welfare from her home in London, in  Cambridge—where Elena was a student at St. Stephen’s College—her father and his second wife each had their own very different image of the girl.  As for Elena, she lived a life of casual and intense physical and emotional  relationships, with scores to settle and goals to achieve–until someone, lying in wait along the route she ran every morning, bludgeoned her to death.Unwilling to turn the killing over to the local police, the university calls in New Scotland Yard.  Thus, Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his  partner, Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, enter the rarefied world of  Cambridge University, where academic gowns often hide murderous intentions.For both officers, the true identity of Elena Weaver proves elusive. Each relationship the girl left behind casts new light both on Elena and on those people who appeared to know her best—from an unsavory Swedish-born  Shakespearean professor to the brooding head of the Deaf Students Union.What’s more, Elena’s father, a Cambridge professor under consideration for a prestigious post, is a man with his own dark secrets.

It’s about the greatest pirate in history, the most powerful executive in the music business, a revolutionary invention and an illegal website four times the size of the iTunes Music Store.\\xa0Journalist Stephen Witt traces the secret history of digital music piracy, from the German audio engineers who invented the mp3, to a North Carolina compact-disc manufacturing plant where factory worker Dell Glover leaked nearly two thousand albums over the course of a decade, to the high-rises of midtown Manhattan where music executive Doug Morris cornered the global market on rap, and, finally, into the darkest recesses of the Internet.Through these interwoven narratives, Witt has written a thrilling book that depicts the moment in history when ordinary life became forever entwined with the world online—when, suddenly, all the music ever recorded was available for free. In the page-turning tradition of writers like Michael Lewis and Lawrence Wright, Witt’s deeply reported first book introduces the unforgettable characters—inventors, executives, factory workers, and smugglers—who revolutionized an entire artform, and reveals for the first time the secret underworld of media pirates that transformed our digital lives.An irresistible never-before-told story of greed, cunning, genius, and deceit, How Music Got Free isn’t just a story of the music industry—it’s a must-read history of the Internet itself.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Music</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Stephen Witt</author>\\n<published>Jun 14, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 320 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780143109341</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/315900/how-music-got-free-by-stephen-witt/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

A disaffected, vaguely idealistic politician in a nameless media-driven modern state where representative politics has dwindled to the corrupt transaction of business as usual and a new foreign war is always breaking out. One night Gifford and his followers seize some radio stations and broadcast a call for freedom—a rebellion that is immediately put down by the government and whose motive will remain forever obscure. Even so, it leads to twenty years of war.A paranoid tour de force of political noir, Clark Gifford’s Body skips back and forth in time, interspersing newspaper clippings and court transcripts with the reactions and reminiscences of the politicians, generals, businessmen, journalists, waiters, and soldiers who double as the actors and the chorus in a drama over which, finally, they have no control. Who here is leading? Who is being led? Fearing’s novel is a pseudo-documentary of a world given over to pseudo-politics and pseudo-events, a prophetic glimpse of the future as a poisonous fog.“I have not developed the habit of reading thrillers, but I have read enough of them to know that from now on Mr. Fearing is my man.”–The New Yorker</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Kenneth Fearing</author>\\n<published>Oct 17, 2006 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781590171820</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/48507/clark-giffords-body-by-kenneth-fearing-introduction-by-robert-polito/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Abandoning stage performances in 1964, Gould concentrated instead on mastering the various media: recordings, radio, television, and print. His sudden death at age fifty stunned the world, but his music and legacy continue to inspire. Philosopher and critic Mark Kingwell regards Gould as a philosopher of music whose ideas about music governed his life. But those ideas were contradictory, mischievous, and deliberately provocative. Instead of a single narrative line to explain the musician, Kingwell adopts a kaleidoscopic approach. Just as Gould played twenty-one “takes” to record the opening aria in the famed 1955 Goldberg Variations, Kingwell offers twenty-one “takes” on Gould’s life. Each version offers a different interpretation of the man, but in each, Kingwell is sensitive to the complex harmonies and dissonances that sounded throughout the life of the great Gould.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Mark Kingwell</author>\\n<published>Sep 22, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 208 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780143173052</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/391874/extraordinary-canadians-glenn-gould-by-mark-kingwell/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Beginning with a concise biography of his subject, Milan Rai presents a sympathetic yet probing analysis of Chomsky’s critique of United States’ media and foreign policy and his vision of a libertarian socialist future.\\xa0Drawing on the entire range of Chomsky’s prodigious output, including little-known interviews and articles, Rai examines Chomsky’s assault on journalistic self-censorship and business control of the mass media. He shows how Chomsky challenges the US’s view of itself as a defender of democracy and equal rights by uncovering the hidden motivations of its foreign policy makers. Rai draws out features of Chomsky’s outlook which are sometimes obscured by a rapid coverage of a wide range of issues. In particular he emphasizes the importance of Chomsky’s cultural critique in his ordering of political priorities.Accessible and comprehensive, Chomsky’s Politics\\xa0serves as an excellent introduction for those confronting Chomsky’s critique for the first time. For those already familiar with his work it corrects some widespread misunderstandings, provides new insights and chronicles the extraordinary contribution of a writer described by the New York Times as “one of the most important intellectuals alive.”</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Milan Rai</author>\\n<published>Jun 17, 1995 </published>\\n<page_num> 232 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781859840115</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233309/chomskys-politics-by-milan-rai/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Jackson, 1964</title>\\n<body>From bestselling author and beloved New Yorker writer Calvin Trillin, a deeply resonant, career-spanning collection of articles on race and racism, from the 1960s to the present In the early sixties, Calvin Trillin got his start as a journalist covering the Civil Rights Movement in the South. Over the next five decades of reporting, he often returned to scenes of racial tension. Now, for the first time, the best of Trillin’s pieces on race in America have been collected in one volume. In the title essay of Jackson, 1964, we experience Trillin’s riveting coverage of the pathbreaking voter registration drive known as the Mississippi Summer Project—coverage that includes an unforgettable airplane conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr., and a young white man sitting across the aisle. (“I’d like to be loved by everyone,” King tells him, “but we can’t always wait for love.”) In the years that follow, Trillin rides along with the National Guard units assigned to patrol black neighborhoods in Wilmington, Delaware; reports on the case of a black homeowner accused of manslaughter in the death of a white teenager in an overwhelmingly white Long Island suburb; and chronicles the remarkable fortunes of the Zulu Social Aid &amp; Pleasure Club, a black carnival krewe in New Orleans whose members parade on Mardi Gras in blackface. He takes on issues that are as relevant today as they were when he wrote about them. Excessive sentencing is examined in a 1970 piece about a black militant in Houston serving thirty years in prison for giving away one marijuana cigarette. The role of race in the use of deadly force by police is highlighted in a 1975 article about an African American shot by a white policeman in Seattle. Uniting all these pieces are Trillin’s unflinching eye and graceful prose. Jackson, 1964 is an indispensable account of a half-century of race and racism in America, through the lens of a master journalist and writer who was there to bear witness.Praise for Jackson, 1964“Trillin’s elegant storytelling and keen observations sometimes churned my wrath about the glacial pace of progress. That’s because to me and millions of African-Americans, the topics of race and poverty—and their adverse impact on the mind and spirit—are, as Trillin acknowledges, not theoretical; they’re personal.”—Dorothy Butler Gilliam,\\xa0The New York Times Book Review\\xa0(Editor’s Choice)“These pieces . . . will continue to be read for the pleasure they deliver as well as for the pain they describe.”—The New York Times “With the diligent clarity, humane wit, polished prose and attention to pertinent detail that exemplify\\xa0Trillin’s journalism at its best . . .\\xa0Jackson, 1964\\xa0drives home a sobering realization: Even with signs of progress, racism in America is news that stays news.”—USA Today “These unsettling tales, elegantly written and wonderfully reported, are like black-and-white snapshots from the national photo album. They depict a society in flux but also stubbornly unmoved through the decades when it comes to many aspects of race relations. . . .

He begins by asking why women have figure so little in the development of science, and then proceeds—in a fascinating and radical analysis—to trace their absence to a deep-rooted legacy of the male-dominated Western religious community. He shows how over the last thousand years science and the practice and institutions of higher learning were dominated by Christian clerics, whose ascetic culture from the late medieval period militated against the inclusion of women in scientific enterprise. He further demonstrates how the attitudes that took hold then remained more or less intact through the Reformation, and still subtly permeate out thinking despite the secularization of learning.Noble also describes how during the first millennium and after, women at times gained amazingly broad intellectual freedom and participated both in clerical activities and in scholarly pursuits. But, as Noble shows, these episodic forays occurred only in the wake of anticlerical movements within the church and without. He suggest finally an impulse toward “defeminization” at the core of the modern scientific and technological enterprise as it work to wrest from one-half of humanity its part in production (the Industrial Revolution’s male appropriation of labor) and reproduction (the millennium-old quest for the artificial womb). An important book that profoundly examine how the culture of Western Science came to be a world without women.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>World History</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>David F Noble</author>\\n<published>Jan 23, 2013 </published>\\n<page_num> 329 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307828521</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/122336/a-world-without-women-by-david-f-noble/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

The six volumes in the series are not only our most  beloved Christmas tales, they also have given us much of what we love  about the holiday itself. A Christmas Carol revived in Victorian  England such Christmas hallmarks as the Christmas tree, holiday cards,  and caroling. The Yuletide yarns of Anthony Trollope popularized  throughout the British Empire and around the world the trappings of  Christmas in London. The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus created the origin story for the presiding spirit of Christmas as we know it.\\xa0The holiday tales of Louisa May Alcott shaped the  ideal of an American Christmas. The Night Before Christmas brought forth some of our earliest Christmas traditions as passed down through folk tales. And The Nutcracker inspired the most famous ballet in history, one seen by millions in the twilight of every year.\\xa0Beautifully  designed hardcovers—with foil-stamped jackets, decorative endpapers, and  nameplates for personalization—in a small trim size that  makes them perfect stocking stuffers, Penguin Christmas Classics embody  the spirit of giving that is at the heart of our most time-honored  stories about the holiday.\\xa0Collect all six Penguin Christmas Classics:\\xa0A Christmas Carol by Charles DickensChristmas at Thompson Hall: And Other Christmas Stories by Anthony TrollopeThe Life and Adventures of Santa Claus by L.

But what dazzles can also destroy, as Gray Marshall is about to discover…\\xa0Gray’s deep talent for magick has won him a place at Merlin College. But when he accompanies four fellow students on a mysterious midnight errand that ends in disaster and death, he is sent away in disgrace—and without a trace of his power. He must spend the summer under the watchful eye of his domineering professor, Appius Callender, working in the gardens of Callender’s country estate and hoping to recover his abilities. And it is there, toiling away on a summer afternoon, that he meets the professor’s daughter.\\xa0Even though she has no talent of her own, Sophie Callender longs to be educated in the lore of magick. Her father has kept her isolated at the estate and forbidden her interest; everyone knows that teaching arcane magickal theory to women is the height of impropriety. But against her father’s wishes, Sophie has studied his ancient volumes on the subject. And in the tall, stammering, yet oddly charming Gray, she finally finds someone who encourages her interest and awakens new ideas and feelings.\\xa0Sophie and Gray’s meeting touches off a series of events that begins to unravel secrets about each of them. And after the king’s closest advisor pays the professor a closed-door visit, they begin to wonder if what Gray witnessed in Oxford might be even more sinister than it seemed. They are determined to find out, no matter the cost…</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Romance</d1><d1>Fantasy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Sylvia Izzo Hunter</author>\\n<published>Sep 02, 2014 </published>\\n<page_num> 432 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780425272459</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/315488/the-midnight-queen-by-sylvia-izzo-hunter/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Born into an affluent family, Leo outwardly seems like a typical daughter of English privilege in the 1870s: she lives with her wealthy married sister Christabel, and lacks for neither dresses nor trinkets.  But Leo has a crippling speech impediment that makes it difficult for her to speak but curiously allows her to mimic other people’s voices flawlessly. Servants and ladies alike call her “Mad Miss Mimic” behind her back… and watch as she unintentionally scares off every potential suitor. Only the impossibly handsome Mr. Thornfax seems interested in Leo…but why? And does he have a connection to the mysterious Black Glove group that has London in its terrifying grasp? Trapped in a city under siege by terror attacks and gripped by opium fever, where doctors (including her brother-in-law) race to patent an injectable formula, Leo must search for truth in increasingly dangerous situations – but to do so, she must first find her voice.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Teen & Young Adult</d0><d1>Teen & Young Adult Historical Fiction</d1><d1>Teen & Young Adult Fiction</d1><d1>Teen & Young Adult Social Issues</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Sarah Henstra</author>\\n<published>Jan 03, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780143192374</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/392432/mad-miss-mimic-by-sarah-henstra/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

New Rule: The next Republican Convention must be held in a giant closet. Every week there’s a new gay Republican outed. I have a feeling that “big tent” they’re always talking about is in their pants. There are so many Republicans in the closet, their symbol shouldn’t be an elephant; it should be a moth.  New Rule: If one of your news organization’s headlines is about who got kicked off Dancing with the Stars last night, you’re no longer a news organization. Sort of like, if you were on Dancing with the Stars last night, you’re no longer a star.  Media, celebrity, Democrats, Republicans, religion, children, marine life, electronics, that couple making out in the next booth—when it comes to lighting up his targets, Bill Maher is an equal-opportunity destroyer. The New New Rules offers Maher’s new and best-loved observations about the world around us, along with some modest tips for its improvement. Because wouldn’t life be a little better if the inside of the office microwave didn’t look like a Jackson Pollock painting, or if fathers stopped signing up their nine-year-olds to win free hunting trips? Scathingly funny and relentlessly unafraid of sensitive topics, Maher’s hilarious brand of realism is more welcome and necessary than ever. So sit back, read on, and enjoy.

As a young girl, she offers English lessons to a teenage survivor of the camps. In “The Ark Builder,” he shares with her the story of his friendship with a proud old builder of synagogue arks, and what happened when the German army invaded their Polish town. As a graduate student, she finds herself escorting a guest lecturer from the Soviet Union, and in “The War Doctor,” her sympathy moves him to put his painful past to paper recounting his experiences as a Soviet NKVD agent who was saved by an idealistic doctor during the Russian civil war, only to encounter him again during the terrifying period of the Kremlin doctors’ plot. And, finally, we meet her in “The Trope Teacher,” in which a distinguished professor of military history, trying to write his memoirs, is distracted by his wife’s illness and by the arrival next door of a new neighbor, the famous writer I. D. (Ilana Davita) Chandal.Poignant and profound, Chaim Potok’s newest fiction is a major addition to his remarkable—and remarkably loved—body of work.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Chaim Potok</author>\\n<published>Jul 30, 2002 </published>\\n<page_num> 304 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780345439987</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/132818/old-men-at-midnight-by-chaim-potok/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Simply Jesus identifies experiences that can awaken the realization of our basic need to focus on Him … like temptation, trouble, and surrender.

As they travel, they write home to wives and eunuchs in the harem and to friends in France and elsewhere. Their colorful observations on the culture differences between West and East conjure up Eastern sensuality, repression, and cruelty in contrast to the freer, more civilized West—but here also unworthy nobles and bishops, frivolous women in fashion, and conceited people of all kinds are satirized. Storytellers as well as letter-writers, Montesquieu’s Usbek and Rica are disrespectful and witty, but also serious moralists. Persian Letters was a succès de scandale in Paris society, and encapsulates the libertarian, critical spirit of the early eighteenth century.C. J. Betts’s translation conveys the color of the original, and his introduction examines the inner meanings of Montesquieu’s satire.

Mandel first establishes that there have indeed been twenty- to twenty-five-year-long waves of capitalist expansion and contraction—and that these have persisted in the period since World War II. He then assembles evidence to show that while broad tendencies in the rate of profit have been decisive in triggering downturns, the ingredients necessary for a new upswing are, by contrast, generally political and extra-economic in character. He thereby demonstrates the falsity of neo-liberal doctrines, according to which the free market will itself generate a new formula for balanced and sustainable expansion.Long Waves of Capitalist Development\\xa0not only offers a penetrating analysis of the ills that have afflicted contemporary capitalist economies but also surveys, and takes forward, one of the classical debates of modern economic history.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ernest Mandel</author>\\n<published>Jun 17, 1995 </published>\\n<page_num> 184 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781859840375</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233239/long-waves-of-capitalist-development-by-ernest-mandel/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Based on Conrad’s own 1890 trip up the Congo River, the story is told by Marlow, the novelist’s alter ego. It is a journey into darkness and horror—both literally, as the narrator descends into a sinister jungle landscape, and metaphorically, as he encounters the morally depraved Mr. Kurtz. The Secret Sharer is the tale of a young sea captain’s first command as he sails into the Gulf of Siam—and into an encounter with his mysterious “double,” the shadow self of the unconscious mind. \\xa0 Joseph Conrad boldly experimented with the novella and novel forms, filled his writing with the exotic places he himself had traveled, and concerned himself with honor, guilt, moral alienation, and sin.

It is not the first time, and a brutal crime ensues.And to everyone’s horror, Grace will not tell the truth. She is a young woman with secrets too horrible to tell, with hurts so deep they may never heal. She is also beautiful enough for men to want her no matter how much she does not want them. Whatever the outcome, Grace Adams will have to live with whatever happened during those terrible years. After a lifetime of being a victim, now she must pay the price for other people’s sins.From the depths of an Illinois women’s prison to a Chicago modeling agency to a challenging career in New York, Grace must carry the past with her wherever she goes. And in healing her own pain, she reaches out to battered women and children who live a nightmare she knows all too well.When Grace meets Charles Mackenzie, a New York lawyer, she has found a man who wants nothing from her-except to heal her, to hear her secrets, and to give her the family she so desperately wants. But, with happiness finally within her grasp, and precious loved ones to protect, Grace is at her most vulnerable-in danger of losing everything to a vicious tabloid press and an enemy from her past, an enemy bent on malice at all costs.With rare insight and power, Danielle Steel writes this extraordinary woman’s story, portraying her struggle to triumph over malice and betrayal, and to transform a lifetime of pain into a blessing for others. Revealing both the stark reality of domestic abuse and the healing power of love, Malice, is more than superb fiction.

The most renowned and beloved poets—Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Hugh MacDiarmid, and Muriel Spark among them—mingle with their lesser-known but equally distinctive compatriots, including many of those who have emerged from the recent Scottish poetry renaissance. The poems are organized by theme: from matters of the heart to subjects spiritual and philosophical to the poetry of place. All of the verse is marked by a characteristic energy, wit, satire, and passionate lyrical intensity, and all demonstrates the power of art that proudly emanates from, but is never limited by, the place of its birth.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Classics</d0><d0>Poetry</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author></author>\\n<published>Jan 06, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307269713</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/24631/scottish-poems-by-edited-by-gerard-carruthers/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

In this engaging book, Richard Kurin shows that cultures are also mediated and indeed brokered by countries, organizations, communities, and individuals — all with their own vision of the truth and varying abilities to impose it on others. Drawing on his diverse experiences in producing exhibitions and public programs, Kurin challenges culture brokers — defined broadly to include museum professionals, film-makers, journalists, festival producers, and scholars of many disciplines — to reveal more clearly the nature of their interpretations, to envision the ways in which their messages can “play” to different audiences, and to better understand the relationship between knowledge, art, politics, and entertainment. The book documents a variety of cases in which the Smithsonian has brokered culture for the American public: a planned exhibit on Jerusalem had to balance both Israeli and Palestinian agendas; debates over the 1996 Olympic Arts Festival presented differing visions of the American South; and the National Air and Space Museum’s controversial display of the Enola Gay prompted the Smithsonian to re-examine the role of national museums. Arguing that cultural exhibits reflect a series of decisions about representing someone, someplace, and something, Reflections of a Culture Broker discusses the ethical and technical problems faced by not only those who practice in a museum setting but also anyone charged with representing culture in a public forum.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Art</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Richard Kurin</author>\\n<published>Nov 17, 1997 </published>\\n<page_num> 332 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781560987574</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/231768/reflections-of-a-culture-broker-by-richard-kurin/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

War Made New begins with the Gunpowder Revolution and explains warfare?s evolution from ritualistic, drawn-out engagements to much deadlier events, precipitating the rise of the modern nation-state. He next explores the triumph of steel and steam during the Industrial Revolution, showing how it powered the spread of European colonial empires. Moving into the twentieth century and the Second Industrial Revolution, Boot examines three critical clashes of World War II to illustrate how new technology such as the tank, radio, and airplane ushered in terrifying new forms of warfare and the rise of centralized, and even totalitarian, world powers. Finally, Boot focuses on the Gulf War, the invasion of Afghanistan, and the Iraq War?arguing that even as cutting-edge technologies have made America the greatest military power in world history, advanced communications systems have allowed decentralized, ?irregular? forces to become an increasingly significant threat.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Military History</d2><d2>Technology</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Popular Science</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Max Boot</author>\\n<published>Aug 16, 2007 </published>\\n<page_num> 656 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781592403158</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292167/war-made-new-by-max-boot/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

What makes it possible for them to attain such spiritual heights as they approach their physical demise? What enables them to make death a completion of life, rather than a tragic end? And what can they teach us about life and death, love and loss, grief and spiritual growth?The way we die, like the way we live, makes a difference—in our lives and the lives of others.From time to time during his work as a pastor, John Fanestil has witnessed someone dying with remarkable and uplifting grace. Fanestil was moved yet puzzled by the spirit of happiness and holiness he observed. Contemporary literature on dying, filled with talk of anger, acceptance, and forgiveness, provided little to explain it. But the chance discovery of articles about the ritual of the “happy death” in religious magazines from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries brought Fanestil the answers he sought.Mrs. Hunter’s Happy Death blends the captivating historical accounts Fanestil uncovered with his own pastoral experiences to reveal the secrets that enable people to transcend pain and suffering and embrace death as a completion of life, not as a tragic end. A fascinating introduction to a historic approach to death and its contemporary incarnations, Mrs. Hunter’s Happy Death also offers specific lessons on living and dying, from the “exercise of prayer” to the “labor of love” to “bearing testimony.”With the spread of in-home medical and hospice care, death is once again being embraced as a natural part of life, infused with profound emotional and spiritual dimensions. The inspiring stories in Mrs. Hunter’s Happy Death beautifully demonstrate that the way we die, like the way we live, makes a supreme difference—in our lives and in the lives of others.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d2>Personal Growth</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>John Fanestil</author>\\n<published>Dec 18, 2007 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307423733</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/47884/mrs-hunters-happy-death-by-john-fanestil/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

As a philosopher, he is concerned with the rational connections of these concepts. As a sociologist, he is prepared to analyze with care the distortions of human interactions caused by existing social and political institutions.\\xa0 In a series of connected essays, the author assesses the function of the contemporary university, and sharply analyzes contemporary students and their political efforts. He\\xa0then brilliantly analyzes as a communications model the relationships between research institutes and the political agencies which employ them. The book concludes with a complex discussion of technology and science as an “ideology,” dedicated to Herbert Marcuse. Critical parts of Marcuse’s thought, Habermas dissects contemporary democratic dialogue and offers an important preliminary sketch of a general theory of social evolution.\\xa0 He analyzes the difference between the technological sphere of control and the practical sphere of communication and interaction as the basic feature of human social life, and explains how and why the predominance of the technological sphere is the distinguishing and alienating characteristic of advanced industrial society.

R. Martin’s classic A Game of Thrones to a stunning finish that merits a place alongside the majestic original on the bookshelf of every fantasy fan. \\xa0 The death of King Robert Baratheon and the imprisonment of his Hand, Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, has set the great houses of Westeros at one another’s throats. \\xa0 In Winterfell, Eddard’s eldest son and heir, Robb Stark, has gathered an army and is pushing south, determined to free his father. Along the way, he pledges to marry the daughter of Lord Walder Frey in exchange for a military advantage that allows him to capture Jaime Lannister—a powerful bargaining chip to ensure Lord Eddard’s safe release. But it is one thing to capture the Kingslayer and quite another to hold him. \\xa0 Meanwhile, in King’s Landing, young King Joffrey has other ideas than an exchange of prisoners. Ignoring the advice of his mother, Queen Cersei, he throws oil on the flames of conflict and ignites a conflagration that seems likely to consume not only the Starks but all of Westeros—unless Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, can bring the mad boy-king to heel. \\xa0 Beyond the Wall, greater dangers are brewing, as a winter as brutal as any in history approaches, bringing with it unnatural creatures out of legend. There, Eddard’s bastard, Jon Snow, must decide once and for all where his loyalties lie. \\xa0 And across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen will learn the true measure of grief—and emerge from its fiery depths transformed, hardened, and ready to claim what is hers by right: the Iron Throne.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Epic Fantasy</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Graphic Novels & Manga</d1><d1>Fantasy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>George R.

These three regiments of the 1st Marine Division–strung out along eighty miles of a narrow mountain road–soon found themselves completely surrounded by 60,000 Chinese soldiers. Despite being given up for lost by the military brass, the 1st Marine Division fought its way out of the frozen mountains, miraculously taking thier dead and wounded with them as they ran the gauntlet of unceasing Chinese attacks.This is the gripping story that Martin Russ tells in his extraordinary book.

Sebald’s first literary work, now translated into English by Michael Hamburger, explores the lives of three men connected by their restless questioning of humankind’s place in the natural world. From the efforts of each, “an order arises, in places beautiful and comforting, though more cruel, too, than the previous state of ignorance.” The first figure is the great German Re-naissance painter Matthias Grünewald. The second is the Enlightenment botanist-explorer Georg Steller, who accompanied Bering to the Arctic. The third is the author himself, who describes his wanderings among landscapes scarred by the wrecked certainties of previous ages.After Nature introduces many of the themes that W. G.

For the short-lived journal Les Révoltes Logiques, Rancière wrote on subjects ranging across a hundred years, from the California Gold Rush to trade-union collaboration with fascism, from early feminism to the “dictatorship of the proletariat,” from the respectability of the Paris Exposition to the disrespectable carousing outside the Paris gates. Rancière characteristically combines telling historical detail with deep insight into the development of the popular mind. In a new preface, he explains why such “rude words” as “people,” “factory,” “proletarians” and “revolution” still need to be spoken.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Jacques Ranciere</author>\\n<published>Jun 01, 2011 </published>\\n<page_num> 192 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781844676972</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233126/staging-the-people-by-jacques-ranciere/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

It may not have been the result of deliberate government policy, yet British ‘obtuseness, short-sightedness and ignorance’ – and stubborn commitment to laissez-faire ‘solutions’ – largely caused the disaster and prevented any serious efforts to relieve suffering. The continuing impact on Anglo-Irish relations was incalculable, the immediate human cost almost inconceivable. In this vivid and disturbing book Cecil Woodham-Smith provides the definitive account.  ‘A moving and terrible book. It combines great literary power with great learning.

The creative literary activity of this epoch likewise betokens on the part of the Greeks an increasingly higher level of self-understanding and self-consciousness, in the best sense of the word. At this time appeared a group of lyric poets, who had looked deeply within their own natures, and through the vehicle of their poetry, made abundantly evident how thoroughly they understood the essential character of man’s inner being. In Greek tragedy as we now have it we meet a fully developed dramatic form….The influence of tragedy on classic comedy is evident in the increasing preoccupation with subjects that are utopian or timeless, [while] the traditional satire on contemporary events and personages recedes more and more into the background.\"— from the Introduction, by Whitney J.

This principle sets his plays apart from the rest, steering them clear of melodrama, and draws the audience into the lives of Chekhov’s colorful characters. Because of his adherence to realism, the playwright has been called an “incomparable artist of life.”*“What makes his work great is that it can be felt and understood not only by any Russian but by anybody in the world.”—*Leo TolstoyWith a Foreword by Robert Brustein\\xa0and an Afterword by Rosamund Bartlett</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Classics</d0><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Literary Collections</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Anton Chekhov</author>\\n<published>Dec 05, 2006 </published>\\n<page_num> 432 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780451530370</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/326542/the-major-plays-by-anton-chekhov/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Before the final performance, $203,000 of the band’s money went missing from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel in what was called the single highest deposit box theft in the city’s history. The money was never recovered. Black Dogs might be the story behind the greatest rock ’n’ roll heist of all time.  the last thing nineteen-year-old Patrick Sullivan needed was a new scam. Just months earlier, he had left a trail of broken friendships and new enemies in Baltimore for a fresh start in New York City after a botched robbery attempt landed one of his best friends in jail. But when he spies a briefcase full of cash backstage at a Led Zeppelin concert, Patrick makes plans for one last crazy mission–one that he hopes will redeem him in the eyes of everyone he left behind. To pull it off, Patrick will have to return to his hometown to round up his crew: Alex, the one who did time for Patrick’s last crime; Frenchy, the neurotic musician who still lives with Mom; and dim-witted but endearing Keith, the greasy-haired loner who excels at installing car stereos and then uninstalling them, all in the same day. When the unlikely team’s plan goes horribly wrong, the boys find themselves mixed up with Backwoods Billy, the psychotic leader of the Holy Ghosts Christian motorcycle gang. They need some help, and they find it in some unlikely places: by crossing paths and making deals with a pill-popping DA, a safe-cracking funk band called the New York Giants, and the Maryland chapter of the Misty Mountain Hoppers Led Zeppelin Fan Club. Sporting a rare 1958 Les Paul guitar and a complicated plan that could either go wonderfully right or horribly wrong, the guys, fueled by beer and egos, make a desperate attempt at robbing the world’s coolest rock band–to hilarious result.Black Dogs brings to life one of the infamously unsolved rock ’n’ roll mysteries and introduces us to a lovable bunch of knuckleheads who may have just pulled off the greatest heist in rock ’n’ roll history.From the Trade Paperback edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Crime Mysteries</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Mystery & Suspense</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Jason Buhrmester</author>\\n<published>Apr 14, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307452023</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/20970/black-dogs-by-jason-buhrmester/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

There is Gringo’s older brother, Pipo, wise beyond his years, a flamboyant, defiant youth and the three-time winner of the sequined Miss Unibers contest; Daddy Groovie, whiling away his days with other hang-about men, out of work and wilting like a guava, clinging to the hope of someday joining his sister in Nuyork; Gringo’s mother, Estrella, moving through their ramshackle home, holding her emotions tight as a fist, which she often clenches in anger after curfew covers the neighborhood in a burst of dark; and Ninang Rola, wise godmother of words, who confides in Gringo a shocking secret from the past–and sets the stage for the profound events to come, in which no one will remain untouched by the jagged pieces of a shattered dream.As Gringo learns; shame is passed down through generations, but so is the life-changing power of blood ties and enduring love.In this lush, richly poetic novel of grinding hardship and resilient triumph, of selfless sacrifice and searing revelation, Bino A.

For more than a decade, Jenna Metcalf has never stopped thinking about her mother, Alice, who mysteriously disappeared in the wake of a tragic accident. Refusing to believe she was abandoned, Jenna searches for her mother regularly online and pores over the pages of Alice’s old journals. A scientist who studied grief among elephants, Alice wrote mostly of her research among the animals she loved, yet Jenna hopes the entries will provide a clue to her mother’s whereabouts. Desperate to find the truth, Jenna enlists two unlikely allies in her quest: Serenity Jones, a psychic who rose to fame finding missing persons, only to later doubt her gifts, and Virgil Stanhope, the jaded private detective who’d originally investigated Alice’s case along with the strange, possibly linked death of one of her colleagues. As the three work together to uncover what happened to Alice, they realize that in asking hard questions, they’ll have to face even harder answers. As Jenna’s memories dovetail with the events in her mother’s journals, the story races to a mesmerizing finish.Praise for Leaving Time“Piercing and uplifting . . . a smart, accessible yarn with a suspenseful puzzle at its core.”—The Boston Globe “Poignant . . . an entertaining tale about parental love, friendship, loss.”—The Washington Post “A riveting drama.”—Us Weekly “[A] moving tale.”—People “A fast-paced, surprise-ending mystery.”—USA Today “In Jenna, [Jodi] Picoult has created an unforgettable character who will easily endear herself to each and every reader. . . .

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Boomeritis</title>\\n<body>Ken Wilber’s latest book is a daring departure from his previous writings—a highly original work of fiction that combines brilliant scholarship with tongue-in-cheek storytelling to present the integral approach to human development that he expounded in more conventional terms in his recent  A Theory of Everything.   The story of a naïve young grad student in computer science and his quest for meaning in a fragmented world provides the setting in which Wilber contrasts the alienated \"flatland\" of scientific materialism with the integral vision, which embraces body, mind, soul, and spirit in self, culture, and nature. The book especially targets one of the most stubborn obstacles to realizing the integral vision: a disease of egocentrism and narcissism that Wilber calls \"boomeritis\" because it seems to plague the baby-boomer generation most of all.  Through a series of sparkling seminar-lectures skillfully interwoven with the hero’s misadventures in the realms of sex, drugs, and popular culture, all of the major tenets of extreme postmodernism are criticized—and exemplified—including the author’s having a bad case of boomeritis himself. Parody, intellectual slapstick, and a mind-twisting surprise ending unite to produce a highly entertaining summary of the work of cutting-edge theorists in human development from around the world.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ken Wilber</author>\\n<published>Sep 09, 2003 </published>\\n<page_num> 464 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781590300084</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/190431/boomeritis-by-ken-wilber/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

They want the Count’s sister, in return they will spare the rest of the city. As houses on the banks of the Seine burn, a debate rages in the Cathedral on the walled island of the city proper. Can the Count really have ambitions to be Emperor of the Franks if he doesn’t do everything he can to save his people? Can he call himself a man if he doesn’t do everything he can to save his sister? His conscience demands one thing, the state demands another. The Count and the church are relying on the living saint, the blind and crippled Jehan of St. Germain, to enlist the aid of God and resolve the situation for them. But the Vikings have their own gods, and outside their camp, a terrifying brother and sister, priests of Odin, have their own agenda–an agenda of darkness and madness. And in the shadows a wolfman lurks. M. D.

Her boss thinks she is tenacious and ambitious; her friends think she is tough, stubborn, and maybe even a bit obsessed. And while Kate has made quite a name for herself for the past five years the only name she’s cared about is Nicolas Fox—an international crook she wants in more ways than one.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0 Audacious, handsome, and dangerously charming, Nicolas Fox is a natural con man, notorious for running elaborate scams on very high-profile people. At first he did it for the money. Now he does it for the thrill. He knows that the FBI has been hot on his trail—particularly Kate O’Hare, who has been watching his every move. For Nick, there’s no greater rush than being pursued by a beautiful woman . . . even one who aims to lock him up. But just when it seems that Nicolas Fox has been captured for good, he pulls off his greatest con of all: He convinces the FBI to offer him a job, working side by side with Special Agent Kate O’Hare. \\xa0 Problem is, teaming up to stop a corrupt investment banker who’s hiding on a private island in Indonesia is going to test O’Hare’s patience and Fox’s skill. Not to mention the skills of their ragtag team made up of flamboyant actors, wanted wheelmen, and Kate’s dad. High-speed chases, pirates, and Toblerone bars are all in a day’s work . . . if O’Hare and Fox don’t kill each other first.Praise for The Heist \\xa0 “The Heist is the perfect title to carry on a trip to the beach.

He is always on the move, never lingering in any one place long enough to risk being discovered. Still, there are certain places he returns to. In the midst of the tumultuous city, they are havens of solitude: like the hushed environs of St. Mary Salome Cemetery, a place where Crispin can feel at peace—safe, at least for a while, from the fearsome memories that plague him . . . and seep into his darkest nightmares. But not only his dreams are haunted. The city he roams with Harley has secrets and mysteries, things unexplainable and maybe unimaginable. Crispin has seen ghosts in the dead of night, and sensed dimensions beyond reason in broad daylight. Hints of things disturbing and strange nibble at the edges of his existence, even as dangers wholly natural and earthbound cast their shadows across his path.

Still trying to prove to the good folks of Baptist Flats, Tennessee, that a woman who’s five-foot-nothing has the mettle to wear a badge, Dani is called in to investigate the death of a man found in a horse’s stall with his pants around his ankles. At first it appears to be a simple accident, but things turn complicated when the victim’s only ID belongs to an ATF agent. A female ATF agent. A missing female ATF agent. To make matters worse, a mystery man named Jack Spivey has come to town, asking questions about the ATF agent’s disappearance and promising a world of pain when he doesn’t like the answers. Then an Amazonian ex-Marine joins in, and Dani has no choice but to team up with these shadowy strangers.

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Freud\\'s Requiem</title>\\n<body>In this absorbing, thoughtful narrative, a young writer explores Sigmund Freud’s provocative ideas on creativity and mortality and their roots in his history, while searching for broader lessons about love, memory, mourning, and creativity.Written in 1915 during winter and wartime, Freud’s little-known essay\\xa0On Transience\\xa0records an afternoon conversation with “a young but already famous poet” and his “taciturn friend” about mortality, eternity, and the “sense” of life. In\\xa0Freud’s Requiem, the philosophical disagreement between Freud and his companions—who may have been the poet Rainer Maria Rilke and his muse and former lover Lou Andreas-Salomé—becomes a prism through which to consider Freud’s creativity as a response to his own experiences, from his passionately curious, lovestruck teenage years to his death after a long struggle with cancer in 1939. Drawing on a variety of literary and historical sources—Homer, Shakespeare, and Goethe, as well as Freud’s own writings, including his letters—Freud’s Requiem\\xa0is both an intimate personal drama and a spirited intellectual inquiry.By tracing the connections among Freud’s ideas, his personality, and the world he lived in,\\xa0Matthew von Unwerth\\xa0examines the links that Freud made between art and memory. Freud’s Requiem contemplates how, in mourning, we tell stories about our lives that give form and meaning to the events and feelings that threaten to overwhelm us. In recounting our stories, especially our darkest moments, we make sense of them and reclaim lost aspects of our lives, just as Freud did in his account of an afternoon walk with a poet and a taciturn companion.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Political Figure Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Psychology</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Matthew Von Unwerth</author>\\n<published>Jul 07, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781440627965</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/288928/freuds-requiem-by-matthew-von-unwerth/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

In Mountains Beyond Mountains, Pulitzer Prize—winning author Tracy Kidder tells the true story of a gifted man who loves the world and has set out to do all he can to cure it.In medical school, Paul Farmer found his life’s calling: to cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most. Kidder’s magnificent account takes us from Harvard to Haiti, Peru, Cuba, and Russia as Farmer changes minds and practices through his dedication to the philosophy that “the only real nation is humanity.” At the heart of this book is the example of a life based on hope and on an understanding of the truth of the Haitian proverb “Beyond mountains there are mountains”–as you solve one problem, another problem presents itself, and so you go on and try to solve that one too.“Mountains Beyond Mountains unfolds with a force of gathering revelation,” says Annie Dillard, and Jonathan Harr notes, “[Paul Farmer] wants to change the world.

But even after the General’s return home, the media has ignored the more important story of how his detention lifted a stranglehold that had suffocated Chile’s moral sensibility for a generation.Award-winning journalist Marc Cooper was a translator to President Allende until the coup of 1973. In this reflection on Chile and the role it has played in his life, he reconstructs the tense atmosphere of the final days of the Allende government, including his hiding and subsequent evacuation under armed UN protection. Twenty-five years later he returns and recounts, in vivid street-level reporting, a country that is a democracy in name only and a society that has been transfigured by one of the most radical, armed capitalist revolutions of our time. Yet, he argues, spasms of protest that seemed like the last rattle of the snake may still presage the crumbling of Chile’s status quo as its people emerge from the long night of reaction to the cry of “Adios General!”</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>World History</d2><d3>Latin American World History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Marc Cooper</author>\\n<published>Jun 17, 2002 </published>\\n<page_num> 158 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781859843604</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233425/pinochet-and-me-by-marc-cooper/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Otto Binder</title>\\n<body>Otto Binder: The Life and Work of a Comic Book and Science Fiction Visionary chronicles the career of Otto Binder, from pulp magazine author to writer of Supergirl, Captain Marvel, and Superman comics. As the originator of the first sentient robot in literature (“I, Robot,” published in Amazing Stories in 1939 and predating Isaac Asimov’s collection of the same name), Binder’s effect on science fiction was profound. Within the world of comic books, he created or co-created much of the Superman universe, including Smallville; Krypto, Superboy’s dog; Supergirl; and the villain Braniac. Binder is also credited with writing many of the first “Bizarro” storylines for DC Comics, as well as for being the main writer for the Captain Marvel comics. In later years, Binder expanded from comic books into pure science writing, publishing dozens of books and articles on the subject of satellites and space travel as well as UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Comic book historian Bill Schelly tells the tale of Otto Binder through comic panels, personal letters, and interviews with Binder’s own family and friends. Schelly weaves together Binder’s professional successes and personal tragedies, including the death of Binder’s only daughter and his wife’s struggle with mental illness. A touching and human story, Otto Binder: The Life and Work of a Comic Book and Science Fiction Visionary is a biography that is both meticulously researched and beautifully told, keeping alive Binder’s spirit of scientific curiosity and whimsy.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Literary Figure Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d2>Arts & Entertainment Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d0>Classics</d0><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Literary Criticism</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Bill Schelly</author>\\n<published>Jun 07, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 352 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781623170370</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536684/otto-binder-by-bill-schelly-foreword-by-richard-a-lupoff/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Drawing on scores of interviews and years of research, Steven F. Hayward takes us on an engrossing journey through the most politically divisive years the United States has had to endure since the decade before the Civil War. Hayward captures an America at war with itself—and an era whose reverberations we feel to this very day. He brings new insight into the profound failure of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, the oddly liberal nature of Richard Nixon’s administration, the significance of Reagan’s years as California’s governor, the sudden-death drama of his near defeat of Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primary, the listlessness of Jimmy Carter’s leadership, and the political earthquake that was Reagan’s victorious presidential campaign in 1980.Provocative, authoritative, and majestic in scope, The Age of Reagan is an unforgettable account of the rebirth and triumph of the American spirit.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Domestic Politics</d2><d2>Political Figure Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Steven F.

But others succeed in establishing a true union, a profound emotional fusion that involves not only sharing a home, but sharing an entire life as well. In Marriage Is for Grownups, Joseph and Lois Bird analyze the problem areas common to most marriages and offer sound guidelines toward solving them and attaining that true union and meaningful relationship.The authors–who have years of experience in marriage counseling–offer no marital nostrums; instead, they encourage each partner to examine his own fears, demands, values, and defenses in order to decide where he wants his marriage relationship to go–and how to reach that goal. The Birds explore many aspects of married life maturely and positively, and at the same time suggest rational ways of confronting them. Whether they’re discussing communications problems, finances, sex, in-laws, children, they do so on a realistic level with the aim of helping married couples become motivated to improve their marital relationship. As Dr. Bird points out, “This is not a marriage ‘cook book,’ providing pat answers which would hopefully apply to all (but which never do). It raises questions by which the spouses can find their own answers.”</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Joseph Bird, Lois Bird</author>\\n<published>Mar 01, 1995 </published>\\n<page_num> 280 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780385042567</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/13781/marriage-is-for-grownups-by-joseph-and-lois-bird/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

What would animals tell us—about themselves, about us—if there were a common language among all animal species? A bracingly simple idea, one that has been used before in books like George Orwell’s Animal Farm and E. B. White’s Charlotte’s Web among others, but never like this. In Animal Envy, Ralph Nader proposes, quite plausibly, that a programmer has created a “digital translation” app whereby animals of different species, from insects to whales, can speak to one another, and through a “hyper-advanced converter” these animals can then also speak, both collectively and individually, to humans. It is decided that there will be a global assembly. It will be called “The Great Talkout.” Humans are persuaded to reserve 100 hours of network coverage so The Great Talkout may begin and will be viewed by humans everywhere, in all human languages, as well as all animal languages. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0The narrative that ensues is deeply felt and powerfully informed.

Now, Meredith Gould reintroduces these customs and rituals to modern Roman Catholics.  Using the liturgical calendar, The Catholic Home provides familiar and new ways to celebrate each season and its special days.  Gould reviews major holy days, select saints’ days, familiar prayers, and suggests meaningful ways to prepare as a family for such sacraments as Baptism, Confirmation, First Eucharist, and Matrimony.This book includes a concise history of each ritual and clarifies the meaning behind it by highlighting celebrations of Catholic holidays from different parts of the globe.  Your family will learn to make Advent wreaths, Jesse trees, St. Lucy’s crowns, King’s cakes, All Souls altars, traditional foods, and participate in family devotions. Throughout The Catholic Home, Gould’s down-to-earth practicality and sense of humor give the activities she describes modern relevance no matter how ancient their origins.  Excerpts from the official Catechism of the Catholic Church are included to illuminate Church doctrine on matters of faith and ritual.

We still have reason to hope for a concrete celebration in 2018”This study of Marx serves not only as an excellent introduction to that most influential of “worldly philosophers” but is also a significant resume of the central issues of Bloch’s own profound and wide-ranging thought.Special attention is given to the political maturation of the young Karl Marx and to his studies and intellectual relationship to important thinkers of his time.

These stories are the real thing, passionate, imaginative, searing.”–Richard Bausch, author of Wives &amp; LoversThe first book of its kind, Operation Homecoming is the result of a major initiative launched by the National Endowment for the Arts to bring distinguished writers to military bases and inspire U.S. Marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen and their families to record their wartime experiences. Encouraged by such authors as Tom Clancy, Mark Bowden, Bobbie Ann Mason, Tobias Wolff, Jeff Shaara, and Marilyn Nelson, American military personnel and their loved ones wrote candidly about what they saw, heard, and felt while in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as on the home front. Taken together, these almost one hundred never-before-published eyewitness accounts, private journals, short stories, letters, and other personal writings become a dramatic narrative that shows the human side of warfare.• the fear and exhilaration of heading into battle;• the interactions between U.S. forces and Afghans and Iraqis, both as enemies and friends;• the boredom, gripes, and humorous incidents of day-to-day life on the front lines;• the anxiety and heartache of worried spouses, parents, and other loved ones on the home front;• the sheer brutality of warfare and the physical and emotional toll it takes on those who fight;• the tearful homecomings for those who returned to the States alive– and the somber ceremonies for those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their nation.From riveting combat accounts to profound reflections on warfare and the pride these troops feel for one another, Operation Homecoming offers an unflinching and intensely revealing look into the lives of extraordinary men and women. What they have written is without question some of the greatest wartime literature ever published.“Andrew Carroll has given America a priceless treasure.”–Tom Brokaw, on War LettersProceeds from this book will be used to provide arts and cultural programming to U.S. military communities.

Sripathi reluctantly travels to Vancouver to bring the child back to India. Nandana has not spoken a word since her parents’ death. Terrified, she resists her distant grandfather. Filled with guilt about his daughter but unable to express his feelings, Sripathi finds everything in his life falling apart. But with Nandana’s arrival, his world slowly, unexpectedly, finds new hope.The Hero’s Walk is a remarkably intimate novel that fills the senses with the unique textures of India. With humor and keen insight, Anita Rau Badami draws us into her story of the graceful heroism of the ordinary.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Anita Rau Badami</author>\\n<published>Feb 26, 2002 </published>\\n<page_num> 384 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780345450920</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/7037/the-heros-walk-by-anita-rau-badami/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Startup tells the story of Kaplan’s wild ride: how he assembled a brilliant but fractious team of engineers, software designers, and investors; pioneered the emerging market for hand-held computers operated with a pen instead of a keyboard; and careened from crisis to crisis without ever losing his passion for a revolutionary idea. Along the way, Kaplan vividly recreates his encounters with eccentric employees, risk-addicted venture capitalists, and industry giants such as Bill Gates, John Sculley, and Mitchell Kapor.

Why do the employees of some organizations fully dedicate themselves while others punch the clock without enthusiasm?   By studying the ins and outs of companies that enjoy extraordinary loyalty from customers and employees, John Jantsch reveals the systematic path to discovering and generating genuine commitment.   Jantsch’s approach is built on three foundational planks, which he calls the clarity path, the culture patron, and the customer promise. He draws on his own experiences and shares true stories from businesses like Threadless, Evernote, and Warby Parker. His strategies include these:  Build your company around a purpose. People commit to companies and stories that have a simple, straightforward purpose.  Understand that culture equals brand. Build your business as a brand that employees and customers will support.  Lead by telling great stories. You can’t attract the right people or get them to commit without telling a story about why you do what you do.  Treat your staff as your customer. A healthy customer community is the natural result of a healthy internal culture.  Serve customers you respect. It’s hard to have an authentic relationship with people you don’t know, like, or trust.   As Jantsch says, “Have you ever encountered a business where everything felt effortless? The experience was perfect, and the products, people, and brand worked together gracefully. You made an odd request; it was greeted with a smile. You went to try a new feature; it was right where it should be. You walked in, sat down, and felt right at home. . . . Businesses that run so smoothly as to seem self-managed aren’t normal. In fact, they are terribly counterintuitive, but terribly simple as it turns out.”   As a follow-up to The Referral Engine, this is about more than just establishing leads- it’s about building a fully alive business that attracts customers for life.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Marketing</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Business</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>John Jantsch</author>\\n<published>Oct 11, 2012 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781591844877</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309321/the-commitment-engine-by-john-jantsch/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

I’d heard the phrase a dozen times before I came to recognize its significance. Lifetime dogs are dogs we love in especially powerful, sometimes inexplicable ways.”–Jon KatzIn this gripping and deeply touching book, bestselling author Jon Katz tells the story of his lifetime dog, Orson: a beautiful border collie–intense, smart, crazy, and unforgettable.From the moment Katz and Orson meet, when the dog springs from his traveling crate at Newark airport and panics the baggage claim area, their relationship is deep, stormy, and loving. At two years old, Katz’s new companion is a great herder of school buses, a scholar of refrigerators, but a dud at herding sheep. Everything Katz attempts– obedience training, herding instruction, a new name, acupuncture, herb and alternative therapies–helps a little but not enough, and not for long. “Like all border collies and many dogs,” Katz writes, “he needed work. I didn’t realize for some time I was the work Orson would find.”While Katz is trying to help his dog, Orson is helping him, shepherding him toward a new life on a two-hundred-year-old hillside farm in upstate New York. There, aided by good neighbors and a tolerant wife, hip-deep in sheep, chickens, donkeys, and more dogs, the man and his canine companion explore meadows, woods, and even stars, wade through snow, bask by a roaring wood stove, and struggle to keep faith with each other. There, with deep love, each embraces his unfolding destiny. A Good Dog is a book to savor. Just as Orson was the author’s lifetime dog, his story is a lifetime treasure–poignant, timeless, and powerful.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1><d1>Pets</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Jon Katz</author>\\n<published>Jun 26, 2007 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780812971491</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/90151/a-good-dog-by-jon-katz/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Little known outside Sweden and rarely published, they survive in surpris\\xadingly large numbers, often with their original furniture and decoration. Twenty of these remarkable and timeless houses are examined here in detail, ranging from royal palaces to farmhouses, all dating from the fifteenth century to the end of the nineteenth century. In spite of being far from the centers of power and artistic influence, these houses reflect the talents of important architects and designers who together forged a distinctive national style. Sweden has been fortunate in its history: while the Hundred Years War reduced much of Europe to ruins, Sweden grew rich, and during the subsequent centuries has enjoyed almost continuous peace. The story of Swedish country houses is thus a mirror of Swedish social history, its hierarchy of classes, its absorption of European styles and movements, and above all its enduring culture. The Swedish Country House is both an impor\\xadtant contribution to design history and a highly seductive glimpse into a secret Nordic world. Art historian Susanna Scherman has included examples from every level, drawing special attention to the qualities that make them unique. She and noted photographer Åke E:son Lindman explored the houses together, and together they bring them to life for the reader.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Susanna Scherman</author>\\n<published>Oct 26, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 224 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781580932943</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/203587/the-swedish-country-house-by-susanna-scherman-photographs-by-ake-eson-lindman/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Borger recounts how Ratko Mladić–now on trial in The Hague–and recently convicted Radovan Karad\\x9eić were finally tracked down, and describes the intrigue behind the arrest of Slobodan Milošević, the Yugoslav president who became the first head of state to stand before an international tribunal for crimes perpetrated in a time of war.

His absence left a single mother to raise four children who kept his incarceration a secret and conjured a mythic father-hero out of his occasional letters. \\xa0 Jeanine’s Irish American mother struggled to support the family in suburban Philadelphia. Summers, she put Jeanine on a plane to Little Havana, where she lived with her Spanish-speaking grandparents and bilingual cousin—a sometimes unreliable translator. It was there in Florida that she met her father face to face, in the prison yards.  \\xa0 As Cornillot travels between these two worlds, a wryly funny and unsentimental narrator emerges. Whether meeting her father for the first time at age six and hoping she looks Cuban enough, imagining herself a girl-revolutionary leading protest marches, dreamily planning her father’s homecoming after his prison break, or writing to demand an end to his forty-four-day hunger strike after he’s recaptured, young Jeanine maintains a hopeful pragmatism that belies her age. \\xa0 Eventually, a child’s mythology is replaced with an adult’s reality in a final reckoning with her father, remarkable for the unsparing honesty on both sides.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Jeanine Cornillot</author>\\n<published>Sep 21, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 240 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780807006177</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/203742/family-sentence-by-jeanine-cornillot/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

This new translation came about because Thich Nhat Hanh believes that the patriarch who originally compiled the Heart Sutra was not sufficiently skillful with his use of language to capture the intention of the Buddha’s teachings—and has resulted in fundamental misunderstandings of the central tenets of Buddhism for almost 2,000 years.  \\xa0 In The Other Shore: A New Translation of the Heart Sutra with Commentaries, Thich Nhat Hanh provides the new translation with commentaries based on his interpretation. Revealing the Buddha’s original intention and insight makes clear what it means to transcend duality and pairs of opposites, such as birth and death, and to touch the ultimate reality and the wisdom of nondiscrimination. By helping to demystify the term “emptiness,” the Heart Sutra is made more accessible and understandable. \\xa0 Prior to the publication of The Other Shore, Thich Nhat Hanh’s translation and commentaries of the Heart Sutra, called The Heart of Understanding, sold more than 120,000 copies in various editions and is one of the most beloved commentaries of this critical teaching. This new book, The Other Shore, supersedes all prior translations.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Thich Nhat Hanh</author>\\n<published>Jul 18, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 196 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781941529140</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/547577/the-other-shore-by-thich-nhat-hanh/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

But then I started thinking about it. Maybe I have learned some things. Maybe I could add something useful to the mix that hadn’t been said already. So I emailed my agent to say I would consider it. Then I broke up with my boyfriend. When my agent telephoned to ask why I hadn’t responded to his emails, the call went something like this: “You can forget about the book. I can’t even write a pamphlet. How in the world am I supposed to give advice when I can’t handle my own love life?” In his pep talk, my agent told me the thing I have going for me is honesty. He told me to picture myself in a coffee shop catching up with friends, trading stories, binding each other’s wounds, laughing, refocusing, and re-emerging as the women God wants us to be.

Brianna Collins needs to break away from her overbearing family. Her parents expect her to “fix” her brother after a series of concussions derailed his hockey career. Unfortunately, no doctor will give him clearance to play, and she’s finished with being the person they rely on to perform a miracle that will never happen.

What’s more, Bree’s the only person who makes him excited about life again. Despite her initial reservations, Luke can’t help pursuing sweet, beautiful Bree.

The concluding chapters of this treatise present a detailed analysis of Mahamudra meditation in relation to Dzogchen practice. This tour de force of scholarly erudition and contemplative insight is made all the more accessible by the lively commentary of the contemporary Nyingma Lama Gyatrul Rinpoche.   Although this book stands alone, it is the concluding section of a single body of teachings by Karma Chagmé, the earlier section published under the title A Spacious Path to Freedom. Karma Chagmé was a major teacher of the Karma Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, and his writings have also become central to the Payul Nyingma order, making him an ideal figure to integrate these two great meditation systems.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Karma Chagme</author>\\n<published>Mar 27, 2000 </published>\\n<page_num> 328 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781559391467</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/224321/naked-awareness-by-karma-chagme/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>CBD</title>\\n<body>This practical, accessible guide to using CBD-dominant cannabis contains a wealth of information for both first-time explorers and experienced patients who want to know more about safely treating a number of health conditions with remarkable results and low to no psychoactivity or negative side effects. CBD (cannabidiol) is a component of cannabis that can provide relief for conditions such as seizures, pain, inflammation, anxiety, depression, arthritis, and a number of other issues. This book offers guidance on various forms of the medicine such as oil infusions, alcohol-based tinctures, capsules, and CO2 concentrated extracts. The information is organized by health condition and also by recommended CBD-rich strains, which do not produce the “highs” associated with THC. With dosage suggestions, potential side effects and contraindications, and the pharmacology of the plant, this is an essential guide for both doctors and patients looking for a nontoxic alternative to opiate-based pain medications and other pharmaceuticals.While cannabis has been used for medicinal and recreational purposes for thousands of years, only in the last fifty years have scientists begun to shed light on the chemistry of the plant and its interactions with the human body. Research has led to the discovery of a whole new system in the body, the endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in mediating functions such as appetite, immunity, mood, pain response, and memory. The authors present case studies, interviews with doctors who prescribe cannabidiol products, and the latest research regarding other active phytocannabinoids and terpenoids present in cannabis that are being studied for medical use. They also address the difference between CBD products derived from industrial hemp or in a lab, versus those made from medical marijuana using the whole plant.\\xa0In addition to offering the most up-to-date and comprehensive information on CBD-dominant cannabis therapy for humans, this book is the first to offer guidance for using the medicine for animals, with suggestions for dosage and delivery and useful forms and strains for common health issues in pets. Finally, the authors take a look at the future of cannabis medicine, charting trends in the legalization movement and suggesting how CBD might be used to fight the opioid epidemic.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Philosophy</d2><d2>Alternative Therapies</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Health & Fitness</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Leonard Leinow, Juliana Birnbaum</author>\\n<published>Oct 31, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 352 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781623171834</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/555842/cbd-by-leonard-leinow-and-juliana-birnbaum/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

The two works translated in this book,  Mumonkan (The Gateless Gate ) and  Hekiganroku (The Blue Cliff Record), both compiled during the Song dynasty in China, are the best known and most frequently studied koan collections, and are classics of Zen literature. They are still used today in a variety of practice lineages, from traditional zendos to modern Zen centers. In a completely new translation, together with original commentaries, the well-known Zen teacher Katsuki Sekida brings to these works the same fresh and pragmatic approach that made his  Zen Training  so successful.

This fascinating book, originally published in 1892, represents the first thorough investigation of this anatomical peculiarity and its application in establishing individual identity for use in law enforcement.Sir Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin and a member of the Royal Geographical Society, had already made a reputation for himself as an explorer of Africa and the founder of the new field of eugenics when he turned his attention to the subject of fingerprints. Through extensive research at his “anthropometric laboratory,” Galton laid out an elementary system of classifying fingerprints based on observed patterns of arches, loops, and whorls. Using meticulous drawings as well as photographs of ink prints, he showed that “the numerous bifurcations, origins, islands, and enclosures in the ridges that compose the pattern, are proved to be almost beyond change.” Thus, he established a sure method of individual identification.Galton’s system was later modified by Sir Edward R. Henry, who became chief of police in London. In 1901, Scotland Yard officially adopted the Galton-Henry system of fingerprinting. Today, it is the most widely used system of fingerprint classification in the world.This classic work will make a welcome addition to the libraries of historians, criminologists, and fans of true crime and forensic science.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Francis Galton</author>\\n<published>Jun 01, 2006 </published>\\n<page_num> 191 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781591024125</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/231424/finger-prints-by-francis-galton/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

He believes that we need to move beyond the concept of the “environment,” as it leads people to experience themselves and Earth as two separate entities and to see the planet only in terms of what it can do for them. Thich Nhat Hanh points to the lack of meaning and connection in peoples’ lives as being the cause of our addiction to consumerism. He deems it vital that we recognize and respond to the stress we are putting on the Earth if civilization is to survive. Rejecting the conventional economic approach, Nhat Hanh shows that mindfulness and a spiritual revolution are needed to protect nature and limit climate change.

A story of the seasons and stepping stones as poignant for parents as for their kids, from the creator of Otis the tractor and illustrator of Love by Matt de la Pena.“Long’s gentle but powerful story about a young tree who holds tight to his leaves, even as everyone else lets theirs drop, takes on nothing less than the pain and sorrow of growing up. . . . As in Long’s unaccountably profound books about Otis the tractor, a pure white background somehow adds to the depth.”—The New York Times Book Review In the middle of a little forest, there lives a Little Tree who loves his life and the splendid leaves that keep him cool in the heat of long summer days. Life is perfect just the way it is. Autumn arrives, and with it the cool winds that ruffle Little Tree’s leaves. One by one the other trees drop their leaves, facing the cold of winter head on. But not Little Tree—he hugs his leaves as tightly as he can. Year after year Little Tree remains unchanged, despite words of encouragement from a squirrel, a fawn, and a fox, his leaves having long since turned brown and withered. As Little Tree sits in the shadow of the other trees, now grown sturdy and tall as though to touch the sun, he remembers when they were all the same size. And he knows he has an important decision to make.From #1\\xa0New York Times\\xa0bestselling Loren Long comes a gorgeously-illustrated story that challenges each of us to have the courage to let go and to reach for the sun.Praise for Little Tree* “The illustrations are beautifully rendered . . . Understated and inviting, young readers will be entranced by Little Tree’s difficult but ultimately rewarding journey.”—Booklist, starred review“Long’s gentle but powerful story about a young tree who holds tight to his leaves, even as everyone else lets theirs drop, takes on nothing less than the pain and sorrow of growing up. Season after season, Little Tree clings to his brown-leaved self until he can take a leap and shed his protection. He feels ‘the harsh cold of winter,’ but soon grows tall and green, and it’s not bad at all. As in Long’s unaccountably profound books about Otis the tractor, a pure white background somehow adds to the depth.”—The New York Times Book Review* “[Long’s] willingness to take his time and even test the audience’s patience with his arboreal hero’s intransigence results in an ending that’s both a big relief and an authentic triumph. Long’s earnest-eloquent narrative voice and distilled, single-plane drawings, both reminiscent of an allegorical pageant, acknowledge the reality of the struggle while offering the promise of brighter days ahead.”—Publishers Weekly, starred review“Long is sparing with the text, keeping it simple and beautifully descriptive. Brilliantly colored illustrations done in acrylic, ink, and pencil stand out on bright white pages, with Little Tree taking the center position in each double-page spread. Tender and gentle and altogether lovely.”—Kirkus Reviews“Children will see the tree facing the scariness of change; adult readers may well feel wistful as the story underscores the need to let their babies grow toward independence.

At first glance, I’m nothing out of the ordinary. I am a daughter. A sister. A friend. When you look at me you won’t see anything that warrants suspicion. I don’t look like a criminal. My name is Hannah Whalen, but most people know me as freed0mov3rdr1v3, or “Freedom Overdrive”—one of the world’s most prolific and notorious hacktivists. My goal—my purpose—is to shed light on the evil that lurks behind the corporate and government lies we have been force-fed for too long.  My story begins with the best possible intention. Devoting my life to exposing the corrupt. The dishonest. The unethical. For that, they label me a cyber-terrorist. Wanted by the FBI, I’ve always been one step ahead.  Until I fell in love. Because I’m sleeping with the man who’s hunting me. And he has no idea that I am his prey. Now I have to decide what’s more important: my freedom or my heart.Note: Exploited ends on a cliffhanger.

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>At All Costs</title>\\n<body>In this gripping, page-turning account, Sam Moses has told a story in the tradition of Sebastian Junger’s A Perfect Storm, Robert Kurson’s Shadow Divers, and Hampton Sides’s Ghost Soldiers. It’s a story about the heroism of two men in battle at sea during World War II, and one woman fleeing Nazi Norway with her child. It’s about how courage can change the course of history.  AT ALL COSTS: How a Crippled Ship and Two American Merchant Marines Turned the Tide of World War II is the astonishing untold account, with original historical reporting, of how two men faced unfathomable danger to help save the island of Malta, Churchill’s crux of the war. In 1942, the tiny island of Malta was the most heavily bombed place on earth. Hitler needed Malta as a stepping-stone to get to the oil in Iraq and Iran (Persia at the time). Blockaded by sea, Malta was running on empty, in food, fuel and ammunition. Axis U-boats and dive-bombers made supply convoys to Malta more like suicide missions. In this last-hope convoy, 50 warships escorted 13 freighters carrying aviation fuel, and a single critical tanker, the SS Ohio, with 107,000 barrels of oil from Texas. Winston Churchill had traveled to Washington and asked FDR for the tanker–his prime ministership was at stake over this mission to Malta. Relentlessly dive-bombed and repeatedly torpedoed, the Ohio suffered huge hits and was abandoned. Two young American merchant mariners–pulled from the sea after their own ship went down in flames–boarded the ravaged tanker, repaired her guns and fought off German and Italian dive-bombers, as the sinking Ohio was towed at 4 knots toward Malta with a tiny crew of volunteers. Sam Moses’ AT ALL COSTS is a triumphant story of human bravery: fearless, selfless acts by men determined to save a ship and win a war; profound communal courage from an island under brutal siege; and leaders who understood the cause of freedom. Kirkus (starred review)A historical footnote provides a riveting tale of true American grit during World War II.In 1942, the island of Malta was the primary launching point in the Mediterranean for Alliedaircraft and submarine attacks against Axis supply convoys. At the height of the North Africancampaign, Rommel’s tanks prepared to sweep into Egypt, Iran and Iraq. The only thing they lacked wasthe fuel to get there, and the shortage was equally desperate on Malta. The Allies launched OperationPedestal, a last-ditch effort to re-supply the base by sending a convoy from Britain through the GibraltarStrait to the beleaguered island. The convoy, which included the American tanker Ohio and the U.S.freighter Santa Elisa, was anything but a milk run. Vietnam vet Moses (Fast Guys, Rich Guys andIdiots, not reviewed) crafts a thrilling adventure on the high seas, though it takes a while to get started.The book’s first third juxtaposes Malta’s plight against the stories of two American merchant seamenon the Santa Elisa: Lonnie Dales and Fred Larsen, through whose eyes the battle will be viewed in bluecollardetail. Once Operation Pedestal begins, the narrative is all action. The convoy comes underrepeated attack, lives are lost, the Santa Elisa is sunk. Dales and Larsen find themselves aboard thewounded Ohio, full to the brim with Texas crude. If they can hold off Nazi attacks and keep their newship afloat long enough to reach Malta, the operation will be a success. Moses takes readers directlyinto the heat of battle, demonstrating a strong command of historical detail.Highly recommended for fans of naval adventure. (Agent: Peter Riva/International Transactions, Inc.)\"At All Costs is an extraordinary work of research and an exciting read that pays tribute to a crucial enterprise taken against incredible odds. Sam Moses has brought the ghastliness of war and the beauty of heroism together, in jarring union.\" –Frank Deford“This book\\xa0tells a great story. But Sam Moses is not just sharing a gripping tale. He is sharing an important and oft neglected story about\\xa0a battle that\\xa0played a decisive role in shaping the outcome of WW II. You will meet people\\xa0who will linger in\\xa0memory for their bravery, foolishness, or wisdom.” –Ken Auletta, author of Backstory“Thrillingly told and beautifully researched, At All Costs is not just the against-all-odds story of the saving of Malta, but also of how the fate of nations can turn on the personal bravery of two ordinary men.”–Robert Kurson, author of Shadow Divers“Sam Moses has skillfully blended the vivid recollections of many eyewitnesses with a wealth of original documentary research to produce an immensely readable and authoritative account of this crucial operation.” –Mark Whitmore, Director of Collections, Imperial War Museum, London, EnglandFrom the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Military History</d2><d3>World War II Military History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Sam Moses</author>\\n<published>Sep 04, 2007 </published>\\n<page_num> 368 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780345476746</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/117903/at-all-costs-by-sam-moses/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

The band has sold more than eighty million records, has broken every concert attendance record set by Elvis Presley and the Beatles, stands behind the Beatles alone in number of gold records from any group in history, and has spawned more than 2,500 licenses. There would have been no KISS without Gene Simmons, the outrageous star whose superlong tongue, legendary sexual exploits, and demonic makeup have made him a rock icon. KISS and Make-Up is the wild, shocking, unbelievable story, from the man himself, about how an immigrant boy from Israel studied to be a rabbi, was saved by rock and roll, and became one of the most notorious rock stars the world has ever seen.Before Gene Simmons there was Chaim Witz, a boy from Haifa, Israel, who had no inkling of the life that lay ahead of him. In vivid detail Gene recounts his childhood growing up in Haifa under the watchful eye of his beloved, strong-willed mother, a concentration camp survivor; his adolescent years attending a Jewish theological center for rabbinical studies in Brooklyn; his love of all things American, including comic books, superheroes, and cowboys; and his early fascination with girls and sex, which prompted him to start a rock band in school after he saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show.KISS and Make-Up is not just the classic story of achieving the American dream through the eyes of an immigrant boy making good, but a juicy, rollicking rock and roll read that takes you along for the ride of your life with KISS, from the 1970s, when they were the biggest band in the world, through the ’80s, when they took off their world-famous war paint, and into the ’90s, when they came back bigger and badder than ever to become the number one touring band in the world. In his own irreverent, unapologetic voice, Gene talks about the girls (4,600 of them and counting); his tight bond with KISS cofounder Paul Stanley; the struggles he and Paul had with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss and their departures from the group; the new band members and Eric Carr’s untimely death; the enormous love and affection he has for the people who put him there in the first place—the KISS Army and the ever-loyal KISS fans around the world; his love life, including stories about his relationships with Cher and Diana Ross and with Shannon Tweed, Playmate of the Year, mother of his son and daughter, and his companion of eighteen years; and much more.Full of dozens of photographs, many never-before-seen pictures from Gene’s private collection, KISS and Make-Up is a surprising, intimate look at the man behind the mask. For the first time Gene reveals all the facets of his complex personality—son, rock star, actor, record producer, businessman, ladies’ man, devoted father, and now author.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Music</d2><d2>Arts & Entertainment Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Gene Simmons</author>\\n<published>Dec 11, 2001 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781400045235</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/167484/kiss-and-make-up-by-gene-simmons/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

This comprehensive guide demonstrates the functions and evolution of specific body systems, explaining how they cooperate to form an upright, intelligent, tool-making marvel, capable of great technological and artistic achievement. Enhanced with 162 beautifully rendered full-color illustrations, the book opens with an introduction to the origins of movement, leading the reader on a journey through time and evolution—from fish to amphibian, quadruped to primate—showing how humans became the preeminent moving beings on the planet.Delving deeper into our upright support system, The Body in Motion clearly describes the workings of the hands and upper limbs; the pelvic girdle; the feet and lower limbs; breathing; the larynx and throat musculature; and more. Central to the book is the idea that it is our upright posture that makes it possible for us to move in an infinite variety of ways, to manipulate objects, to form speech, and to perform the complex rotational movements that underlie many of our most sophisticated skills. These systems, Dimon argues persuasively, have helped us build, invent, create art, explore the world, and imbue life with a contemplative, spiritual dimension that would otherwise not exist.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Health & Reference</d2><d2>Alternative Therapies</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Health & Fitness</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Theodore Dimon Jr</author>\\n<published>Jan 25, 2011 </published>\\n<page_num> 128 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781556439704</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/226332/the-body-in-motion-by-theodore-dimon-jr/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>The Erotic History of Advertising</title>\\n<body>Victoria’s Secret and Calvin Klein are brand names practically synonymous with sexually suggestive advertising. Considering their high public profile and huge profits, anyone can see that sex sells. Despite polls indicating that the public would like to see less sex in advertising, Americans don’t mean what they say. They continue to respond to the lure of provocative marketing and, most important to business, they buy. Knowing this, more and more advertisers are testing the limits of public taste in the highly competitive battle to capture the consumer’s attention.All of this is well documented in Tom Reichert’s profusely illustrated book, The Erotic History of Advertising. As Reichert amply demonstrates, the use of sex in advertising is far from being a recent fad. As long ago as the 1880s, Duke Cigarettes enclosed in their packs not baseball cards but similar small cards showing scantily clad “women of the stage,” which encouraged purchasers to keep buying to complete the whole set. In the 1920s Woodbury soap became the market leader largely through ads with images of romantic situations and claims that Woodbury soap made a woman’s skin irresistible to the touch. In the 1930s White Owl cigars had great success in marketing through ads showing attractive couples locked in a passionate kiss, suggesting that only White Owls left the breath smelling pleasant. Warner Lambert capitalized on the same kind of imagery for decades to connect Listerine mouthwash with romantic success.With numerous illustrations showing many erotic ads–some campy, some esthetically elegant, some homoerotic–that push the boundaries of sexuality and taste from over a century of product marketing, Reichert not only tracks the history of sex in advertising but also explores the many factors that make the link between sex and our consumer culture so successful. Among other things, he considers the range of salacious imagery, from mildly suggestive to the use of outright nudity; the emotional impact of sexy ads; the influence of sex on brand recognition; what works and what doesn’t; the differences between male and female responses; and the possible harms of using sex in advertising, especially in regard to young audiences and the perpetuation of female stereotypes.This thoughtful, enjoyable, and fascinating look into the world of advertising–from the late 1800s to the most erotic ads of today–will appeal to both media-savvy consumers and aficionados of pop culture.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Psychology</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Tom Reichert</author>\\n<published>May 01, 2003 </published>\\n<page_num> 300 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781591020851</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/230872/the-erotic-history-of-advertising-by-tom-reichert/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>The Figurative Artist\\'s Handbook</title>\\n<body>An Authoritative, Comprehensive Guide for Contemporary Figurative Artists \\xa0At a time when renewed interest in figurative art is surging throughout the art world, author Robert Zeller presents The Figurative Artist’s Handbook—the first comprehensive guide to figure drawing and painting to appear in decades. \\xa0 Illustrated with Zeller’s own exquisite drawings and paintings as well as works by nearly 100 historical and contemporary figurative art masters, the handbook is also a treasure trove of the finest figurative art of the past and the present day. Included are Michelangelo, Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Peter Paul Rubens, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Gustav Klimt, Edward Hopper, Andrew Loomis, Andrew Wyeth, Lucian Freud, Odd Nerdrum, Eric Fischl, Bo Bartlett, Steven Assael, John Currin, and many others. \\xa0Original and thoroughly modern in his approach, Zeller brings together three figure-drawing methods long thought to be at odds, synthesizing these seemingly incompatible techniques to achieve a cohesive and complete understanding of the human figure. Although all three methods underlie contemporary fine-arts practice and education, no artist’s handbook has ever combined them before: \\xa0 The Study of Gesture (Disegno): Rooted in the Italian Mannerist style of the 16th and 17th centuries, the gestural method emphasizes life, rhythm, and movement in the human body. \\xa0 The Structural Approach: A mainstay of 20th- and 21st-century art instruction, this method applies an architectural perspective to the body, using a block conception for anatomically sound, solid figures. \\xa0\\xa0  The Atelier Method: Based on the training provided by 18th- and 19th-century art academies, the atelier approach creates sensual, smooth renderings based on meticulous study of the figure’s surface morphology in light and shadow. \\xa0 Covering all the basics as well as many advanced techniques, The Figurative Artist’s Handbook is aimed at both students and experienced artists.

Deep within the walls of the Kremlin, Stalin’s top man hatches a brilliant plan that will alter the course of postwar history—and it’s all based on a deception as simple as the shell game. Five years later, an atomic bomb detonates deep within the borders of the Soviet Union, stunning the experts who had predicted that Russian science could not produce such a devastating weapon for at least another generation.The Red Eagles traces the adventures of two spies, Jack Kuznetsky and Amy Brandon, as they track down the most deadly force in the world while hiding their true allegiances and intentions from their compatriots.

In his most important work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), Keynes critiqued the laissez-faire policies of his day, particularly the proposition that a normally functioning market economy would bring full employment. Keynes’s forward-looking work transformed economics from merely a descriptive and analytic discipline into one that is policy oriented.

But when the wounds run deep, forgiveness doesn’t come easy.This eye-opening study deals with the difficult questions of forgiveness, including How can I forgive when the pain is so great? Does forgiving mean I have to forget the past? and What if I choose not to forgive? As you dig into what the Bible says on this vital topic, you’ll encounter the depths of God’s own mercy and discover how choosing forgiveness can free you from a painful past and propel you toward being all that God intends you to be.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Kay Arthur, David Lawson, BJ Lawson</author>\\n<published>Jul 21, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 96 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307457592</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/5183/forgiveness-breaking-the-power-of-the-past-by-kay-arthur-and-david-and-bj-lawson/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

And they still get ahead! Why? As psychologist Adrienne Mendell learned when she interviewed one-hundred male executives, the traits that women spend their entire lives erasing from their personalities are actually the qualities that men value in the world of work. And since men are still in the power positions, if you don’t play it their way, you don’t play at all.Based on Mendell’s interviews and her experience of counseling hundreds of frustrated career women, How Men Think identifies the seven rules that men learned by playing sports as children–games that excluded girls. These rules may seem simple on the surface, but understanding them as men do is anything but easy. You may have fallen into many of these traps yourself:* You’re mad because you want your male boss to let you control your projects. But you’ve got to take control–that’s the only way you’ll get it.* You’re steamed because a male colleague consistently takes credit for your work. Do you make a point of touting your accomplishments?* When you make a mistake you apologize. But the man you apologize to doesn’t think you’re polite–he thinks you’re admitting incompetence.* A fight with a male colleague leaves you shaken. But the men in your office shout at each other for an hour and then go out for a beer.These are the times that try women’s souls! The strategies, insights, and eye-opening advice in How Men Think will help you get along better with the boys and propel you to the top where you belong.\"The more women have opportunities to play sports the more proficient they will become in competing in this men’s world of ‘unwritten rules.’ To bridge the gap, Mendell’s book, How Men Think, is a necessary guide for women working with men.\"–Diane Everett, Ph.D. Executive Director National Association for Girls and Women in Sport</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Psychology</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Adrienne Mendell</author>\\n<published>Apr 16, 1996 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780449909782</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/113261/how-men-think-by-adrienne-mendell-ma/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Whether you call it flexitarian, part-time veganism, or vegetable-centric, the plant-based, real-food approach to eating introduced in Bittman’s New York Times bestselling book VB6 has helped countless people regain their good health, control their weight, and forge a smarter, more ethical relationship with food. VB6 does away with the hard and fast rules, the calorie-counting, and the portion control of conventional diets; it’s a regimen that is designed to be easy toa dopt and stick to for a lifetime.\\xa0 When Bittman committed to a vegan before 6:00 pm diet, he quickly realized that everything about it became easier if he cooked his own meals at home. In The VB6 Cookbook he makes this proposition more convenient than you could imagine. Drawing on a\\xa0varied and enticing pantry of vegan staples strategically punctuated with “treat” foods (including meat and other animal products), he has created a versatile repertoire of recipes that makes following his plan simple, satisfying, and sustainable.\\xa0 Breakfasts, the most challenging meal of the day for some vegans, are well represented here, with a full range of hot cereals, whirl-and-go-dairy free smoothies, toast toppers, and brunch-worthy entrees. Lunches include hearty soupls, sandwiches, beans, grains, and pastas to pack along wherever the day takes you, and more than a dozen snack recipes provide the perfect afternoon pick-me-up to banish the vending-machine cravings that can undo a day of eating well. Dinners are flexitarian,\\xa0focusing on vegetable-forward meals that are augmented by a range of animal products for fullest flavor, satisfaction, and nutrient density. A chapter devoted entirely to “building blocks”–make-ahead components you mix and match–ensures that a flavorful and healthy meal is never more than a few minutes away. If you’ve thought of trying a vegan diet but worry it’s too monotonous or unfamiliar, or simply don’t want to give up foods you love to eat, Bittman’s vegan and flexitarian recipes will help you cook your way to a new, varied and quite simply better way of eating you can really commit to…for life.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Diet & Nutrition</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Cooking</d1><d1>Health & Fitness</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Mark Bittman</author>\\n<published>May 06, 2014 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780385344821</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/223052/the-vb6-cookbook-by-mark-bittman-author-of-how-to-cook-everything/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

And since anxiety has a mind of its own, logic and reassurance often fail, leaving parents increasingly frustrated about how to help. Now Lawrence J. Cohen, Ph.D., the author of Playful Parenting, provides a special set of tools to handle childhood anxiety. Offering simple, effective strategies that build connection through fun, play, and empathy, Dr. Cohen helps parents \\xa0 • start from a place of warmth, compassion, and understanding • teach children the basics of the body’s “security system”: alert, alarm, assessment, and all clear.  • promote tolerance of uncertainty and discomfort by finding the balance between outright avoidance and “white-knuckling” through a fear • find lighthearted ways to release tension in the moment, labeling stressful emotions on a child-friendly scale  • tackle their own anxieties so they can stay calm when a child is distressed • bring children out of their anxious thoughts and into their bodies by using relaxation, breathing, writing, drawing, and playful roughhousing \\xa0 With this insightful resource of easy-to-implement solutions and strategies, you and your child can experience the opposite of worry, anxiety, and fear and embrace connection, trust, and joy. \\xa0 Praise for The Opposite of Worry \\xa0“The Opposite of Worry is an informative resource for parents and other family members. The book is easy to read, comprehensive and notable for its many practical suggestions.”—New England Psychologist“Good advice for parents making daily calls to the pediatrician . . . Anxiety is a full-body sport, and Cohen’s main advice is not to treat it with words but with actions. . . .

Intended for parents of children ages 3 to 15, this book offers anecdotes and fun anti-anxiety games.”—Publishers Weekly \\xa0 “Here’s the help parents of anxious children have been looking for! Dr. Cohen’s genius is in the warm and generous spirit of the strategies he outlines for parents. He grounds his playful approach in a sound explanation of how anxiety affects children, and how they heal. Parents will come away with plenty of ideas to help them develop their children’s confidence. While reading, I found myself thinking, ‘I’d like to try that for myself!’”—Patty Wipfler, founder and program director, Hand in Hand Parenting \\xa0 “If you want to understand your child’s anxiety—and your own parental worries—you must read Larry Cohen’s brilliant book, The Opposite of Worry. Dr. Cohen is one of the most imaginative and thoughtful psychologists you will ever encounter. He explains how and why children become anxious and then shows how we can use empathy and play to help them escape from the terrifying dark corners of childhood.”—Michael Thompson, Ph.D. \\xa0 “The Opposite of Worry offers a treasure trove of ideas to help children feel confident and secure.

As a result, the lives of women and children have suffered dramatically, as society has come to tolerate their victimization.Using the unique program at the Oakland Men’s Project in California as a basis, Paul Kivel, one of its founding members, shares an extraordinary approach to stopping male violence. The key is understanding and evading the cultural forces that box men in and often reward them for violent behavior. Through exercises, thought-provoking questions, and intense self-examination, Men’s Work helps men learn new rules and new roles in personal relationships and in the world at large.Men’s Work gives back to men the power and responsibility they need to unlearn the lessons of control and aggression. Going beyond the mythology of the current men’s movement, this revolutionary work identifies and develops the social and political framework on which to place men’s individual efforts to recover their humanity.From the Paperback edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Paul Kivel</author>\\n<published>Mar 01, 1995 </published>\\n<page_num> 320 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780345471857</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/93419/mens-work-by-paul-kivel/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

The author argues that the future can only be safeguarded by a global humanistic outlook that recognizes and respects differing cultural perspectives and endorses the use of critical reason and empiricism. Houk coins the term “culturalism” to describe dogmatic viewpoints governed by culture-specific values and preconceived notions. Culturalism gives rise not only to fundamentalism in religion but also stereotypes about race, gender, and sexual orientation.Turning specifically to Christian fundamentalism, the author analyzes the many weaknesses of what he calls a faith-based epistemology, particularly as such thinking is displayed in young-earth creationism, the reliance on revelation and subjective experiences as a source of religious knowledge, and the reverence accorded the Bible despite its obvious flaws. As he points out, the problem with such cultural knowledge generally is that it is non-falsifiable and ultimately has no lasting value in contrast to the data-based and falsifiable knowledge produced by science, which continues to prove its worth as a reliable source of accurate information.Concluding that there is no future to the fundamentalist mindset in a diverse world where religion often exacerbates conflicts, he makes a strong case for reason and mutual tolerance.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>James T.

Kierkegaard struck out against all forms of established order–including the established church–that work to make men complacent with themselves and thereby obscure their personal responsibility to encounter God. He considered Training in Christianity his most important book. It represented his effort to replace what he believed had become \"an amiable, sentimental paganism\" with authentic Christianity.

As the first national news anchor to combine traditional network news with the power of social-networking tools like Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook, CNN’s Rick Sanchez doesn’t just talk to Americans—he hears directly from them, unfiltered, every day. As Rick says, “It wasn’t me talking. It was we talking.”  Viewers tweet at Rick daily, so he knows they are sick of “conventional idiocy” like death panels, birthers, and blind partisanship. Luckily, Rick Sanchez is listening, and he’s here to provide the takeaway.Watch a Video</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Technology</d2><d2>Domestic Politics</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1><d1>Popular Science</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Rick Sanchez</author>\\n<published>Sep 07, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781101459898</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307087/conventional-idiocy-by-rick-sanchez/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Charming and funny, this read is simply delightful.”—Bustle “A deadpan comic debut for the procrastination generation.”—The GuardianClaire Flannery has just quit her office job, hoping to take some time to discover her real passion. The problem is, she’s not exactly sure how to go about finding it. Without the distractions of a regular routine, Claire confronts the best and worst parts of herself: the generous, attentive part that visits her grandmother for tea and cooks special meals for her boyfriend, Luke, and the part that she feels will never measure up and makes regrettable comments after too many glasses of wine. What emerges is a candid, moving portrait of a clear-eyed heroine trying to forge her own way, a wholly relatable character whose imperfections and uncanny observations highlight what makes us all different and yet inescapably linked. Praise for Not Working “Ruefully funny . . . features a kind of millennial Bridget Jones whose red wine–and–TED Talk–fueled pursuit of a higher purpose in life leads to hard truths and hangovers.”—Vogue“In this laugh-out-loud debut, Claire Flannery is a lost soul who quits her day job to discover her true passion. In taking a hard look at her own character, Claire finds that her loveable qualities are sometimes squashed by mistakes, like the evenings she blurts inappropriate remarks after too many glasses of wine. [Lisa] Owens’s story is a smart, relatable and delicious debut.”—Harper’s Bazaar \\xa0 “It’s no mean feat to fashion a novel out of the stuff of everyday life. . . . Fortunately, Owens is quite a writer. . . . Not Working works because there is lots going on beneath its placid, ordinary surface. . . . With this funny, serious debut, Lisa Owens has proved that she’s one to watch.”—The New Statesman “There are sharp observations about generational change, particularly on the topic of work. . . . The novel is a light read but it raises some timely issues. . . . A secure job with a future is not that easy to find, as Claire’s comic and compelling tale serves to show. This book offers a form of catharsis for anyone who has felt that they are not quite doing their job right. . . . It is soothing to find you are not the only one noodling along in your career.”—Financial Times “Stellar . . . [Owens has an] ability to take the potentially trite problem-of-the-privileged trope and deftly craft it into readable fun.”—Publishers Weekly “Owens offers a millennial take on the traditional British chick-lit heroine. . . . Claire is a realistically awkward character who will appeal to readers looking for a less-angsty take on the new adult trend.”—Booklist  “A novel as insightful about the contemporary dilemmas facing young professionals as it is sharp, incisive and laugh-out-loud funny.”—The Observer“Lots of people say they laugh out loud when they read a book they love. But in the case of Not Working, I really did laugh out loud, often and raucously.”—Elisabeth Egan, author of A Window OpensFrom the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Women’s Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Lisa Owens</author>\\n<published>May 03, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780812988826</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/532073/not-working-by-lisa-owens/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Under favorable circumstances, this process results in emotional healing, a radical shift in values, and a profound awareness of the mystical dimension of existence.  For some, these changes are gradual and relatively smooth, but for others they can be so rapid and dramatic that they interfere with effective everyday functioning, creating tremendous inner turmoil.  Unfortunately, many traditional health-care professionals do not recognize the positive potential of these crises; they often see them as manifestations of mental disease and repsond with stigmatizing labels, suppressive drugs, and even institutionalization.In The Stormy Search for the Self, Christina and Stanislav Grof, the world’s foremost authorities on the subject of spiritual emergence, draw on years of dramatic personal and professional experience with transformative states to explore these “spiritual emergencies,” altered states so powerful they threaten to overwhelm the individual’s oridinary reality.  This book will provide insights, assurances, and practical suggestions for those who are experiencing or have experienced such a crisis, for their families and friends, and for mental-health professionals.  It is also a valuable guide for anyone involved in personal transformation whose experiences, though generally untraumatic, may still at times be bewildering or disorienting.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Christina Grof</author>\\n<published>Jun 01, 1992 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780874776492</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/349573/the-stormy-search-for-the-self-by-christina-grof/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Change will have to come from below. Agenda for a New Economy is the handbook for that revolution. In this revised and updated edition David Korten has fleshed out his vision of the alternative to the corporate Wall Street economy: a Main Street economy based on locally owned, community-oriented “living enterprises” whose success is measured as much by their positive impact on people and the environment as by their positive balance sheet.  We will lose nothing in the process because, as Korten ably demonstrates, the supposed services Wall Street offers are simply a con game. And Korten now offers more in-depth advice on how to mount a grassroots campaign to bring about an economy based on shared prosperity, ecological stewardship, and citizen democracy.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0>\\n</topics>\\n<author>David C.

Not so in Howard Storm’s case.Storm, an avowed atheist, was awaiting emergency surgery when he realized that he was at death’s door. Storm found himself out of his own body, looking down on the hospital room scene below. Next, rather than going “toward the light,” he found himself being torturously dragged to excruciating realms of darkness and death, where he was physically assaulted by monstrous beings of evil. His description of his pure terror and torture is unnerving in its utter originality and convincing detail.Finally, drawn away from death and transported to the realm of heaven, Storm met angelic beings as well as the God of Creation. In this fascinating account, Storm tells of his “life review,” his conversation with God, even answers to age-old questions such as why the Holocaust was allowed to take place. Storm was sent back to his body with a new knowledge of the purpose of life here on earth. This book is his message of hope.\"This is a book you devour from cover to cover, and pass on to others. This is a book you will quote in your daily conversation. Storm was meant to write it and we were meant to read it.\"-From the foreward by Anne RiceAs I lay on the ground, my tormentors swarming around me, a voice emerged from my chest. It sounded like my voice, but it wasn’t a thought of mine. I didn’t say it. The voice that sounded like my voice, but wasn’t, said, “Pray to God.” I remember thinking, “Why? What a stupid idea. That doesn’t work. What a cop-out . . .”  That voice said it again, “Pray to God!” It was more definite this time. I wasn’t sure what to do. Praying, for me as a child, had been something I had watched adults doing. It was something fancy and had to be done just so. I tried to remember prayers from my childhood experiences in Sunday school. Prayer was something you memorized. What could I remember from so long ago? Tentatively, I murmured a line, which was a jumble from the Twenty-third Psalm, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” the Lord’s Prayer, the Pledge of Allegiance, and “God Bless America,” and whatever other churchly sounding phrases came to mind.“Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. For purple mountain majesty, mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord. Deliver us from evil. One nation under God. God Bless America.”To my amazement, the cruel, merciless beings tearing the life out of me were incited to rage by my ragged prayer. It was as if I were throwing boiling oil on them. They screamed at me, “There is no God! Who do you think you’re talking to? Nobody can hear you! Now we are really going to hurt you.” They spoke in the most obscene language, worse than any blasphemy said on earth.

The handcuffed and chained patient, Oscar Bane, has specifically asked for her, and when she literally has her gloved hands on him, he begins to talk—and the story he has to tell turns out to be one of the most bizarre she has ever heard.The injuries, he says, were sustained in the course of a murder . . . that he did not commit. Is Bane a criminally insane stalker who has fixed on Scarpetta? Or is his paranoid tale true, and it is he who is being spied on, followed and stalked by the actual killer? The one thing Scarpetta knows for certain is that a woman has been tortured and murdered—and more violent deaths will follow. Gradually, an inexplicable and horrifying truth emerges: Whoever is committing the crimes knows where his prey is at all times. Is it a person, a government? And what is the connection between the victims?In the days that follow, Scarpetta; her forensic psychologist husband, Benton Wesley; and her niece, Lucy, who has recently formed her own forensic computer investigation firm in New York, will undertake a harrowing chase through cyberspace and the all-too-real streets of the city—an odyssey that will take them at once to places they never knew, and much, much too close to home.Throughout, Cornwell delivers shocking twists and turns, and the kind of cutting-edge technology that only she can provide.

Lewis is initially delighted with his new bedroom, a secluded tower in a remote part of the house. Then he discovers that it’s already occupied — by the ghosts of seven dead pirates. Worse, the ghosts expect him to help them re-take their ship, now restored and on display in a local museum, so they can make their way to Libertalia, a legendary pirate utopia. The only problem is that this motley crew hasn’t left the house in almost two hundred years and is terrified of going outside.

But What If We’re Wrong? is a book of original, reported, interconnected pieces, which speculate on the likelihood that many universally accepted, deeply ingrained cultural and scientific beliefs will someday seem absurd. Covering a spectrum of objective and subjective topics, the book attempts to visualize present-day society the way it will be viewed in a distant future. Klosterman cites original interviews with a wide variety of thinkers and experts — including George Saunders, David Byrne, Jonathan Lethem, Alex Ross, Kathryn Schulz, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Brian Greene, Junot Díaz, Amanda Petrusich, Ryan Adams, Dan Carlin, Nick Bostrom, and Richard Linklater. Klosterman asks straightforward questions that are profound in their simplicity, and the answers he explores and integrates with his own analysis generate the most thought-provoking and propulsive book of his career.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Classics</d0><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Literary Collections</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Chuck Klosterman</author>\\n<published>Apr 25, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780399184130</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533521/but-what-if-were-wrong-by-chuck-klosterman/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

As the Permanent President of the International Brotherhood of Concierges and Hall Porters, he and his service industry brothers are privy to huge amounts of sensitive, exclusive information and gossip from heads of state, world leaders, diplomats, and the wealthy, which they happen to overhear while working in the rooms, dining halls, and elevators of Geneva’s finest hotels. As waiters, porters, and servants, they are trusted to be silent about such weighty matters-top secret information that, in the wrong hands, could change the course of world events.A self-appointed revolutionary humanitarian, M. Rene gathers some of his trusted brothers to reveal his plan to form a secret conspiracy of distinguished servants who will record the conversations of their clients, gather their correspondences, and spy on their actions. M. Rene confides his plan, “It is always at a table that statesmen are at their most unguarded. Waiters have golden opportunities for this kind of work. . . . Who needs spies if they have concierges, waiters, and valets?” Is the purpose bribery or blackmail? Will the power be transferred to those who have none? Will the plan benefit the world, or place free countries in great danger? As these questions arise, the conspiracy brings to light assassinations, secret clauses in treaties, government conspiracies, and more.What unravels is a novel of suspense, intrigue, and danger, territory that Sir Peter Ustinov has mastered in this original literary triumph.

He was allowed ten words—he used three: “I AM ALIVE!” This message, classic in its poignancy of suffering and despair captures only too well what it meant to be a prisoner of the Japanese Army.Now, acclaimed military historian Major Bruce Norton USMC (Ret.) brings to light a long-forgotten memoir by a marine captured at Corregidor in the spring of 1942 and interned for three devastating years by the Japanese. With unflinching prose, the words of Marine Sergeant Major Charles Jackson describe the fierce yet impossible battle for Corregidor, the surrender of thousands of his comrades, the long forced marches, and the lethal reality of the P.O.W. camps. Joining some of the most important eyewitness accounts of war, I AM ALIVE! is a testament to the men who fought and died for their country. Jackson’s unembellished account of what his fellow soldiers endured in the face of inhumanity pays tribute to the men who served America during the war—and shows why we would ultimately prevail.From the Paperback edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Military History</d2><d2>U.S. History</d2><d3>World War II Military History</d3><d3>20th Century U.S. History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Charles Jackson, Major Bruce H.

Mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters, sisters-in-law, new mothers, friends, and even strangers offer what seems to be an endless supply of supposedly authoritative opinions on every aspect of pregnancy: A craving for spicy food denotes a boy. Carrying the baby low denotes a girl. Besides gender predictions, a pregnant woman is also apt to acquire an earful of advice about miscarriage, dietary habits and cravings, hair growth, weight gain, and childbirth. And, of course, everyone wants to touch her belly. In this engaging, humorous, and very informative book, Drs. Shawn A. Tassone and Kathryn Landherr—experienced obstetricians and gynecologists, a husband-and-wife team of physicians, and parents of four children—explore the most common superstitions and myths surrounding pregnancy. From their combined twenty years of work in a clinic, as well as their own parenting experience, the authors review the anecdotes and beliefs, from the slightly unusual to the stranger-than-fiction, and compare them with the scientific evidence. Moving through each stage, from the early weeks of pregnancy to delivery, they examine the legends about diet, gender identification, preterm labor, the umbilical cord, initiating labor, and the size and movement of the fetus. As they detail the scientific perspective on these varied and often amusing beliefs, the authors not only entertain but provide a great deal of practical information, which will ease the fears and anxieties of expectant parents as well as clear up many confusing notions. If you are pregnant, you owe it to yourself to get this book. Better yet, suggest it as the perfect shower gift to all those well-meaning advice givers.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Parenting</d1><d1>Health & Fitness</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Shawn A.

Hailed by the Los Angeles Times as the “newest name after Wells, Verne, Huxley, and Orwell,” Callenbach offers a visionary blueprint for the survival of our planet . . . and our future.Ecotopia was founded when northern California, Oregon, and Washington seceded from the Union to create a “stable-state” ecosystem: the perfect balance between human beings and the environment. Now, twenty years later, this isolated, mysterious nation is welcoming its first officially sanctioned American visitor: New York Times-Post reporter Will Weston.Skeptical yet curious about this green new world, Weston is determined to report his findings objectively. But from the start, he’s alternately impressed and unsettled by the laws governing Ecotopia’s earth-friendly agenda: energy-efficient “mini-cities” to eliminate urban sprawl, zero-tolerance pollution control, tree worship, ritual war games, and a woman-dominated government that has instituted such peaceful revolutions as the twenty-hour workweek and employee ownership of farms and businesses. His old beliefs challenged, his cynicism replaced by hope, Weston meets a sexually forthright Ecotopian woman and undertakes a relationship whose intensity will lead him to a critical choice between two worlds.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ernest Callenbach</author>\\n<published>Mar 01, 1990 </published>\\n<page_num> 192 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780553348477</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23059/ecotopia-by-ernest-callenbach/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Because no one other than Jesus Christ can live it, for the simple reason that He is the Christian life! And only He can live it in our lives as well. Major W. Ian Thomas takes a refreshing look at the pure thrill of living victoriously as you embrace the living Savior’s presence within you. The more you become genuinely and relentlessly available to Christ, the more He can take over so that your Christian walk becomes vibrant and effective! This inspiring devotional, along with the application questions at the end of each reading, will help you focus consistently on Jesus Himself so you can serve and enjoy Him at an entirely new level and dimension. You can try to steer clear of sin. Avoid temptation. Refuse to steal, lie, or use drugs and alcohol. You can indeed try to be sinless. But that is still you. And you are still trying. Jesus Christ was not holy because He focused His efforts on avoiding sin. Instead, “He refused to allow there to be any possible explanation for the quality of His life but the Father, as God, dwelling in Him, as Man,” writes Major W. Ian Thomas. So whom do you want dwelling in you? More of you? Or all of Christ? Story Behind the BookMajor W. Ian Thomas was twelve years old when he accepted the Lord with a simple prayer. But by nineteen, “I had been reduced to spiritual exhaustion,” he says, “with no hope or reason for going on.” It was then that he discovered the life-transforming secret of the indwelling life of the living Lord Jesus Christ. God gave him a message through Galatians 2:20, where he learned to say, “Lord Jesus, I can’t—You never said I could—but You can, and always said You would. That is all I need to know.” Major Thomas came to understand it was Christ Himself living through him who would do His work. This is the message he has been passionately proclaiming all his life.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Major Ian Thomas</author>\\n<published>Dec 30, 2008 </published>\\n<page_num> 176 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307562975</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/177868/the-indwelling-life-of-christ-by-major-ian-thomas/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",
       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Philosophy in Crisis</title>\\n<body>Is philosophy dead? Some philosophers have declared it to be so, and judging by some of the mental acrobatics now fashionable in postmodernist circles a reasonable person might have to agree. Though recognizing the moribund state of current academic philosophy, Mario Bunge feels that this is a crisis from which the discipline can and will recover. To overcome the impasse Bunge argues that it is necessary to reconstruct philosophy by building a philosophical system that addresses real-world problems of everyday people in a clear, comprehensible fashion. The new system must be exact and compatible with contemporary science and technology. Above all, it should shun purely academic problems.This book offers glimpses of such a system while avoiding technical jargon unfamiliar to the lay reader. It is thus accessible to the average educated reader interested in such perennial philosophical concerns as What is matter?, What is mind?, What is the nature of society?, Are there limits to our knowledge?, What are the criteria for distinguishing genuine science from pseudoscience?, and How should human rights be balanced with moral obligations? These questions will always be of interest to thinking human beings, says Bunge, and philosophy, rather than becoming a fruitless, self-referential academic game, should be the main intellectual tool for exploring and clarifying such all important issues.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Mario Augusto Bunge</author>\\n<published>Jan 01, 2001 </published>\\n<page_num> 245 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781573928434</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/230639/philosophy-in-crisis-by-mario-augusto-bunge/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

The Tantric tradition is a unique collection of lesser-known texts, concepts, and meditation practices that are usually made available only to experienced and specially initiated practitioners.  The \"Vajra World\" ( vajradhatu in Sanskrit) is a realm of indestructibility, the level of reality beyond all thought and imagination, all impermanence and change, which a fully realized person knows and inhabits. Used metaphorically, \"Vajra World\" refers to the traditional culture of Tibet and the unique spirituality that is its secret strength.    Topics include:  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The tantric view of human nature and the external world \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The special role of the guru, or tantric mentor \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The preliminary practices that prepare the student for full initiation \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The major dimensions of Vajrayana practice, including visualizations, liturgies, and inner yogas  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The tradition of the  tulku, or incarnate lama \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The lore surrounding the death of ordinary people and of saints \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•\\xa0 The practice of solitary retreat, the epitome of traditional Tibetan Buddhism   Secret of the Vajra World  is the companion volume to the author’s earlier book,  Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism.  While that book focuses on the history, cosmology, philosophy, and practice of the more public, exoteric side of Tibetan Buddhism, this work treats its more hidden and esoteric aspects as they take shape in Vajrayana.

The response of the radical King to our catastrophic moment can be put in one word: revolution—a revolution in our priorities, a reevaluation of our values, a reinvigoration of our public life, and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens. . . . Could it be that we know so little of the radical King because such courage defies our market-driven world?”\\xa0—Cornel West, from the Introduction Every year, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is celebrated as one of the greatest orators in US history, an ambassador for nonviolence who became perhaps the most recognizable leader of the civil rights movement. But after more than forty years, few people appreciate how truly radical he was. Arranged thematically in four parts, The Radical King includes twenty-three selections, curated and introduced by Dr. Cornel West, that illustrate King’s revolutionary vision, underscoring his identification with the poor, his unapologetic opposition to the Vietnam War, and his crusade against global imperialism. As West writes, “Although much of America did not know the radical King—and too few know today—the FBI and US government did. They called him ‘the most dangerous man in America.’ . . .

James Houston takes us inside this central American myth in a compelling new way that only a novelist can achieve.The people whose dreams, courage, terror, ingenuity, and fate we share are James Frazier Reed, one of the leaders of the Donner Party, and his wife and four children—in particular his eight-year-old daughter, Patty. From the moment we meet Reed—proud, headstrong, yet a devoted husband and father—traveling with his family in the \"Palace Car,\" a huge, specially built covered wagon transporting the Reeds in grand style, the stage is set for trouble. And as they journey across the country, thrilling to new sights and new friends, coping with outbursts of conflict and constant danger, trouble comes. It comes in the fateful choice of a wrong route, which causes the group to arrive at the foot of the Sierra Nevada too late to cross into the promised land before the snows block the way. It comes in the sudden fight between Reed and a drover—a fight that exiles Reed from the others, sending him solo over the mountains ahead of the storms.We follow Reed during the next five months as he travels around northern California, trying desperately to find means and men to rescue his family. And through the amazingly imagined \"Trail Notes\" of Patty Reed, who recollects late in life her experiences as a child, we also follow the main group, progressively stranded and starving on the Nevada side of the Sierras.Snow Mountain Passage is an extraordinary tale of pride and redemption. What happens—who dies, who survives, and why—is brilliantly, grippingly told.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>James D.

M. Homes was given up for adoption before she was born. Her biological mother was a twenty-two-year-old single woman who was having an affair with a much older married man with a family of his own. The Mistress’s Daughter is the ruthlessly honest account of what happened when, thirty years later, her birth parents came looking for her. Homes relates how they initially made contact and what happened afterwards, and digs through the family history of both sets of her parents in a twenty-first-century electronic search for self. Daring, heartbreaking, and startlingly funny, Homes’s memoir is a brave and profoundly moving consideration of identity and family.“A compelling, devastating, and furiously good book written with an honesty few of us would risk.” —Zadie Smith\\xa0“I fell in love with it from the first page and read compulsively to the end.” —Amy Tan</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Parenting</d1><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>A.

In one direction is the neon glare of his father’s recent suicide, and in the other is the tough love of his fluorescent mother. He’d love to find love, but he can’t make it twenty minutes into a first date without spotting that fatal flaw. In spite of Matthew’s better intentions, he always finds himself back at the same old place: 555-PUMP, “New York’s only phone line for men who are serious about their bodies!” Eventually, even Matthew realizes the long odds of making a love connection on a sex line, but then the pound sign connects him to Henry. Much to his dismay, Matthew can’t find a single problem with him. In fact, Henry may be just the one to lead Matthew past his recent tragedies and childhood traumas. If Matthew lets himself follow, that is.

Vintage fashionista and amateur sleuth Charley Carpenter finds out in this engrossing cozy mystery from the USA Today bestselling author of The Book Club Murders. \\xa0 In a small town like Oakwood, Ohio, everyone knows everyone else’s business—except for Charley Carpenter’s standoffish new neighbors, who tend to keep to themselves. But behind closed doors, Paxton Sharpe’s habit of screaming bloody murder at all hours of the day keeps Charley awake all night. Coupled with the stress of the increasingly delayed expansion of her shop, Old Hat Vintage Fashions, the insomnia is driving Charley crazy. Her only distraction? The local paper’s irreverent new advice column, “Ask Jackie.” \\xa0 Jackie’s biting commentary usually leaves Charley and her employees rolling on the floor, but her latest column is no laughing matter. An oddly phrased query hinting at a child in peril immediately puts Charley on high alert. After arriving home to a bloodcurdling scream next door, she follows the noise into the basement and makes a grisly discovery: the body of Judith Sharpe’s adult daughter. \\xa0 With Detective Marcus Trenault off in Chicago, Charley decides to take matters into her own hands. Convinced that the murder is connected to the desperate plea for help in “Ask Jackie,” she embarks on a twisted investigation that has her keeping up with the Sharpes—before a killer strikes again. \\xa0 Leslie Nagel’s delightful Oakwood Mystery novels can be enjoyed together or separately: THE BOOK CLUB MURDERS | THE ANTIQUE HOUSE MURDERS | THE ADVICE COLUMN MURDERS</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Cozy Mysteries</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Mystery & Suspense</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Leslie Nagel</author>\\n<published>Apr 03, 2018 </published>\\n<page_num> 277 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780425285220</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/541254/the-advice-column-murders-by-leslie-nagel/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

To walk in the footsteps of Jesus means making sacrifices like those he made if one is to imitate the example of Christ every day.In The Low Road to New Heights, Wellington Boone elucidates the often difficult path to becoming a true disciple of Christ. Through examples drawn from real life and passages from the Bible, Bishop Boone gets to the heart of the matter: by living a humble life, Christians can conform to the character of Jesus. In an engaging style, Boone offers a serious spiritual regimen–a kind of high-energy Christian aerobics routine–that will last a lifetime. For those who want to move from being Christians in name only to being spiritually committed followers of Christ, Boone provides the no-nonsense, down-to-earth advice and inspiration they need to achieve their goal.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Wellington Boone</author>\\n<published>Nov 18, 2003 </published>\\n<page_num> 210 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781578568611</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/16045/the-low-road-to-new-heights-by-wellington-boone/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Drawing on nearly five decades of research as well as forty-five years working as a psychoanalyst, Nathan Schwartz-Salant explains that, in a world where vast amounts of order are being created through the growing success of science and technology, the concomitant disorder is having devastating effects upon relationships, society, and the environment.\\xa0As a Jungian analyst with training in the physical sciences, Schwartz-Salant is uniquely qualified to explore scientific conceptions of energy, information, and entropy alongside their mythical antecedents.\\xa0He analyzes the possible effects of created disorder, including its negative consequences for the creator of the preceding order as well as its potentially transformative functions. With many examples of the interaction of order and disorder in everyday life and psychotherapy,\\xa0The Order-Disorder Paradox\\xa0makes\\xa0new inroads into our understanding of the wide-ranging consequences of the order we create and its effects on others and the environment.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Psychology</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Nathan Schwartz-Salant</author>\\n<published>Apr 11, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 176 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781623171162</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/548664/the-order-disorder-paradox-by-nathan-schwartz-salant/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",
       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Walter Benjamin</title>\\n<body>Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) was one of the most intriguing and original Marxist cultural theorists of the twentieth-century. He made a precarious living in Berlin as a literary journalist and, partly under the influence of Ernst Bloch and Lukacs, turned toward the Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School. In the late 1920’s, he became a close friend of Brecht, championing his revolutionary “epic theater”. Driven from Germany in 1933 by the rise of Nazism, Benjamin settled in Paris where he had close associations with the surrealists. When the Nazis invaded France, Benjamin fled to the Spanish frontier where on being denied entry, he committed suicide rather than risk being delivered to the SS.Benjamin’s writings are a curious mixture of esoteric, sometimes mystical Jewish thought, artistic modernism, and unorthodox Marxism. He united an apocalyptic vision of history with a concern for the material, productive basis of art. Fascinated by tradition, yet a radical spokesman for the new technological media, steeped in high German philosophy, but a champion of the proletariat, Benjamin was in turn philologist, literary critic, political commentator, and philosopher of history. Bolz and van Reijen proceed from the standpoint that Benjamin’s thought was shaped by his attempt to connect extremes—to make the theological idea of salvation fruitful for political thought. Then, they go on to structure Benjamin’s important clusters of themes in light of the radical consequences of this intention.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Nobert Bolz</author>\\n<published>Jun 01, 1991 </published>\\n<page_num> 120 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781573924290</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/230391/walter-benjamin-by-norbert-bolz/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Until the first century BC, glass was made only in Western Asia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean regions; its manufacture then spread to China and other areas. The peoples of the Roman Empire included the most versatile glassmakers\\xa0in the ancient world, leading to both widely available low-cost \\xa0glassware and stunning \\xa0luxury glass. During \\xa0the Middle Ages, Islamic glassworkers \\xa0decorated \\xa0their fine cut glass with gilding and brilliant enamel. In the\\xa015th century, the focus of luxury glassmaking shifted to Venice. Glassmaking \\xa0in Europe \\xa0was transformed again in the\\xa017th\\xa0\\xa0century, when thick-walled \\xa0objects with cut and engraved ornament were in great demand. By the nineteenth century, \\xa0glassmaking was well established in America, where, as in Europe, industrial processes were developed to supply the rapidly expanding population with glassware for daily use. Within the past\\xa050 years glass has gained acceptance as a medium for artistic expression, and the Studio Glass Movement, born in the United \\xa0States, has inspired artists all over the world to explore its unique properties. Glass tells this sweeping story from ancient times to the present in an accessible text with gorgeous examples.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Technology</d2><d2>Art</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Popular Science</d1><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>David Whitehouse</author>\\n<published>May 29, 2012 </published>\\n<page_num> 128 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781588343246</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215384/glass-by-david-whitehouse/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>Riches within Your Reach!</title>\\n<body>Trusted and beloved by readers everywhere for his prosperity classic The Secret of the Ages, Robert Collier takes the next step in Riches Within Your Reach! and explains how to harness mental visualization to achieve financial and professional success.  “A definite purpose, held on to in the face of every discouragement and failure, in spite of all obstacles and opposition, will win no matter what the odds,” wrote Robert Collier. And with faith in your own definite purpose, taught the self-help master, there is no limit to what you can accomplish. In every adversity, there lies the seed of an equivalent advantage, and in each defeat, there is a lesson in how to achieve victory next time. This is the message of Riches Within Your Reach!  In 1947, Collier produced Riches Within Your Reach! to assemble his most talked-about works into one simple guide. It features: The God in You (1937); The Magic Word (1940); The Secret of Power (1945); and The Law of Higher Potential (1947).  Together, these pioneering works reveal all facets of one powerful secret: Human beings, since the dawn of history, have used the applied principles of mental visualization to achieve their aims. Many of the world’s most successful figures -from Napoleon Bonaparte to Benjamin Franklin to Andrew Carnegie-began their lives at a significant disadvantage, without the wealth or health that many of their peers enjoyed. Yet they were able to triumph and succeed in ways that their contemporaries weren’t-by tapping into the infinite power of their own minds. Riches Within Your Reach! not only builds upon this teaching but illuminates Collier’s most remarkable lesson ever: that each of us has an equal chance to harness the powers within ourselves to succeed, but first, we must learn how to focus our desires.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d2>Inspiration & Motivation</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Robert Collier</author>\\n<published>Dec 24, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 592 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781585427673</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/306418/riches-within-your-reach-by-robert-collier/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

During that time, the Church of the Hallowed Pact has assigned a new bishop to the city—but it has also made its displeasure at the death of its clergyman quite clear. Davillon’s economy has suffered beneath the weight of the Church’s displeasure. Much of the populace—angry at the clergy— has turned away from the Church hierarchy, choosing private worship or small, independent shrines. And the bishop, concerned for his new position and angry at the people of Davillon, plans to do something about it.\\xa0But a supernatural threat is stalking the nighttime streets—a creature of the other world has come to infiltrate the seedier streets of Davillon, to intertwine its tendrils through the lower echelons of society. Faced with both political upheaval and a supernatural threat to its citizenry, the local representatives of the Church are paralyzed and the Guardsmen are in over their heads.\\xa0And then there’s Widdershins–who’s tried, and failed, to stay out of trouble since taking over Genevieve’s tavern; who’s known to the Church and the Guard both, and trusted by neither; who may, with some of her Thieves’ Guild contacts, have unwittingly played a part in the bishop’s plans; and who, along with her personal god Olgun, may be the only real threat to the supernatural evil infesting Davillon.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Teen & Young Adult</d0><d1>Teen & Young Adult Fantasy Fiction</d1><d1>Teen & Young Adult Fiction</d1><d1>Teen & Young Adult Action & Adventure</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ari Marmell</author>\\n<published>Jun 26, 2012 </published>\\n<page_num> 281 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781616146214</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/231016/false-covenant-by-ari-marmell/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

All aspects of baseball—hitting, pitching, and baserunning—are affected by the Code, a set of unwritten rules that governs the Major League game. Some of these rules are openly discussed (don’t steal a base with a big lead late in the game), while others are known only to a minority of players (don’t cross between the catcher and the pitcher on the way to the batter’s box). In The Baseball Codes, old-timers and all-time greats share their insights into the game’s most hallowed—and least known—traditions. For the learned and the casual baseball fan alike, the result is illuminating and thoroughly entertaining.  \\xa0 At the heart of this book are incredible and often hilarious stories involving national heroes (like Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays) and notorious headhunters (like Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale) in a century-long series of confrontations over respect, honor, and the soul of the game. With The Baseball Codes, we see for the first time the game as it’s actually played, through the eyes of the players on the field. \\xa0 With rollicking stories from the past and new perspectives on baseball’s informal rulebook, The Baseball Codes is a must for every fan.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Sports</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Jason Turbow, Michael Duca</author>\\n<published>Mar 22, 2011 </published>\\n<page_num> 304 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307278623</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/43386/the-baseball-codes-by-jason-turbow-with-michael-duca/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>The Psychology of Baseball</title>\\n<body>Get inside the minds of the stars of the diamond in this extraordinary tour of brain power, psyche, and sheer will.Yogi Berra once said, “Baseball is 90 percent mental. The other half is physical.” Even so, the Yankee great may have underestimated the brain power professional baseball players routinely draw on to perform such astounding feats of athleticism as hitting 98-mph fastballs and diving to catch line drives. In The Psychology of Baseball, Mike Stadler goes beneath the surface of the game to explore the psychology behind the actions of the game’s greats–and breaks down legendary moments from baseball history, such as Willie Mays’s full-sprint over-the-shoulder grab in the 1954 World Series.Stadler begins with the mind’s role in the game’s basic skills, explaining the anticipatory thinking that can make a hitter see a “rising fastball,” the complex muscular coordination required to throw a major league heater, and the intense spatial calculations the brain must perform in a split second in order for a fielder to catch a struck ball. Stadler then discusses the hidden nature of streaks and slumps, explaining why a “hot” hitter is most likely just getting lucky and why there’s no such thing as a clutch hitter, and also looks at the psychological basis of the so-called “sophomore slump” and the effect that a big-money contract has on a player’s performance. He also examines the personality types that are best suited to baseball, and explains what traits are most associated with success at the highest levels.A revolutionary new look at America’s pastime that will appeal to the many fans of bestsellers like Moneyball and Three Nights in August, The Psychology of Baseball is a must-read book for the serious baseball fan.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Sports</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Mike Stadler</author>\\n<published>Apr 05, 2007 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781440623257</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/296900/the-psychology-of-baseball-by-mike-stadler/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>SOM</title>\\n<body>Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, founded in 1936, is one of the largest and most influential architecture firms in the world. SOM has long been known for innovation, experimentation, design excellence, and technical mastery, for an abiding interest in the contributions that buildings can make to the life of cities, and for a collaborative approach that extends to all aspects of the design and construction processes. This volume presents work from the late 1990s and 2000s.In an era of true globalization in design and commerce, SOM has come to occupy a unique place in American and international architecture. Recognized for the exceptional quality of its architectural design and urban planning, the firm is also renowned for its clients, an eminent group of businesses and institutions. In the years 1997–2008, the period represented in this monograph, SOM’s steadfast dedication to a modern expression has produced an important series of works at all scales, in a variety of typologies, in countries around the world. From the diminutive Skyscraper Museum in New York City to the radiant Cathedral of Christ the Light in Oakland, California, to the master plan and two buildings for the University of California Merced, the newest U.C. campus, the works shown here illustrate the remarkable range of SOM’s current practice.Perhaps no work exemplifies the firm’s creative, multifaceted approach as much as 7 World Trade Center, the first structure built at the World Trade Center after September 11, 2001. On a site claimed by commerce but also subject to the demands of memory, SOM created an elegant stainless-steel and glass tower that restores the New York City street grid and begins the process of remaking this part of the city. A suggestive combination of artistic and structural expertise, dedication to finding sustainable design solutions, collaborations with preeminent artists and designers, and commitment to urbanism characterize not only 7 World Trade Center but SOM’s recent body of work.Among the projects shown is the massive U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, the first federal office building to receive a LEED rating. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing elegantly responds to the local culture and site. An abundance of airport projects—in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Israel, and Singapore—shows SOM’s mastery of this complex project type. The firm’s commitment to urbanism and its ability to work at a large scale on sites of great visibility are evident in the designs for the Time Warner Center in New York and Tokyo Midtown, as well as in a series of grand master plans: Chongming Island in Shanghai, the redevelopment of the waterfront in Alexandria, Egypt, and Treasure Island in the San Francisco Bay. At the same time, the firm often works at a fine scale, as in the Burr Street School in Connecticut, the retail prototype for Charles Schwab, and the Condé Nast Cafeteria in New York. Kenneth Frampton brings a historian’s perspective to SOM’s recent work, tracing its evolution back to the Miesian modernism dominant at the time of the firm’s founding and forward to the cutting-edge technical advances to which the firm has devoted itself. Large-span structures, high-rise towers, low-rise topographic forms, compositions that incorporate media, and constructivist essays: all contribute to the development of contemporary architecture and contemporary urbanism alike. Well into its eighth decade of practice, SOM continues on a course of twenty-first century modernism, a modernism that is diverse and inclusive, contextual, urbane, and populist.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author></author>\\n<published>Nov 17, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781580932240</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/55345/som-by-introduction-by-kenneth-frampton/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Its central propositions are twofold: first, that the national question, however its terms have changed, is the still under-theorized and unresolved problem that haunts the hyper-abstractions and mystifications of postcolonial theory and other ideological flights into ‘globalization’; second, that the important insight into the close cultural link between ‘nation’ and ‘narration’ must be carried further so as to disclose their concretely historical, fully determinate relationship.In essays that first engage the current theoretical parlances of ‘ambivalence’, ‘hybridity’ and the ‘subaltern’, and that go on to flesh out an alternative ‘political narratology’ through readings of Cortazar, Carpentier, Garcia Marquez, Rulfo and Vargas Llosa, Larsen concludes with a critical reassessment of Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities. In place of the cultural essentializing of third-worldisms and of the indeterminacies of Bhabhaite or Spivakian textualism, Determinations develops a dialectical, radically historicized account of the national and the colonial as literary and cultural mediations.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Classics</d0><d1>Literary Criticism</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Neil Larsen</author>\\n<published>Sep 17, 2001 </published>\\n<page_num> 216 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781859843291</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233204/determinations-by-neil-larsen/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

So when a small-time con artist tells her about forty people ready to tumble down the space elevator to break free from her old bosses, she checks it out — against her better judgment.

With settings ranging from wartime China to an island off the coast of British Columbia, the ten stories in this collection represent the year’s best short fiction by some of our most exciting emerging voices.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 A young boy who believes he is being stalked by an unstoppable, malevolent entity discovers that he may not be the only one. In a sweeping story set against the fall of Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War, a pregnant woman waits anxiously for her doctor husband to leave the city before it’s too late. A river that runs through a First Nations community is the source of sustenance, escape, and tragedy for a girl and her family. The haunting footage of the politically motivated self-immolation has unexpected reverberations for a Tibetan-Canadian woman dealing with multiple conflicts in her own life. A man who works a back-breaking job at an industrial mat cleaning service is pushed to his limit. When her mother has to return to Kinshasa to bury a family member, a girl gradually learns of the intricacy and depth of grief, in an evocative piece that illuminates the cultural gaps common within immigrant families, and the power of food and stories to bridge them.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 The stories included in the anthology are contenders for the $10,000 Journey Prize, which is made possible by Pulitzer Prize-winning author James A. Michener’s donation of Canadian royalties from his novel Journey, which McClelland &amp; Stewart published in 1988. The 2017 winner will be announced by the Writers’ Trust of Canada in November 2017.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author></author>\\n<published>Oct 20, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 208 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780771048203</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557941/the-journey-prize-stories-29-by-various/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Now a major motion picture starring Daniel Radcliffe.\\xa0\\xa0Arthur Kipps is an up-and-coming London solicitor who is sent to Crythin Gifford—a faraway town in the windswept salt marshes beyond Nine Lives Causeway—to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of a client, Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House.

The routine business trip he anticipated quickly takes a horrifying turn when he finds himself haunted by a series of mysterious sounds and images—a rocking chair in a deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child’s scream in the fog, and, most terrifying of all, a ghostly woman dressed all in black.

Gina begins to realize that for the first time since Ben’s death, she’s getting her senses back. As both pain and joy reenter her world, Gina discovers that she is able to accept feeling in order to live fully once more. But the biggest surprise for Gina is her relationship with Angel.

It has been edited  with the needs of English-speaking users in mind, whether students,  teachers, business people, or casual linguists, and special care has  been taken at each stage of its compilation including the selection of  entry words and their equivalents, the wording of the detailed  explanations of Japanese words, the choice of example sentences, and  even its functional page design to maximize its usefulness.What is furigana and why is it so important?Furigana  refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to  show their pronunciation. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who  is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most  difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either  provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of  the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries  were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no  Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential  curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that  demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest  stages. Learners and their teachers using such curricula will inevitably  feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha s Furigana  Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with a  familiar and authentic kana script.Combining Kodansha’s Furigana  Japanese-English Dictionary (1995) and Kodansha’s Furigana  English-Japanese Dictionary (1996) in one portable. affordable, and  user-friendly volume, this dictionary has the following unique features:•\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A basic vocabulary of 30,000 entries covers the most frequently used English and Japanese words•\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Special treatment has been given to hundreds of words, names, and  phrases of special relevance to English-speaking students of Japanese•\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions are explained in clear English•\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Thousands of example sentences and phrases illustrate how Japanese words are used in context•\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Special information is provided on verb conjugations, formality, and other aspects of Japanese grammar and usage</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Language</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Reference</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Masatoshi Yoshida, Yoshikatsu Nakamura</author>\\n<published>Nov 16, 2012 </published>\\n<page_num> 1318 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781568364575</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563481/kodanshas-furigana-japanese-dictionary-by-masatoshi-yoshida-and-yoshikatsu-nakamura/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group—the fabled “Lost Generation”—that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F.

Out of the last hours of Virgil’s life and the final stirrings of his consciousness, the Austrian writer Hermann Broch fashioned one of the great works of twentieth-century modernism, a book that embraces an entire world and renders it with an immediacy that is at once sensual and profound. Begun while Broch was imprisoned in a German concentration camp, The Death of Virgil is part historical novel and part prose poem — and always an intensely musical and immensely evocative meditation on the relation between life and death, the ancient and the modern.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Hermann Broch</author>\\n<published>Jan 15, 1995 </published>\\n<page_num> 496 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780679755487</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/18548/death-of-virgil-by-hermann-broch/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

She struggles with blood-starved vamps from another dimension and swarms of green demon children with a penchant for nibbling on faces, and, as barriers between alternate realities erode, nightmare versions of friends and long-dead enemies must be dealt with. Then Buffy’s own death &amp;mdash; having sacrificed herself for Dawn &amp;mdash; takes a toll on the Scoobies, as they deal with demons and crazed forest creatures in a tale by Amber Benson (“Tara”) and Christopher Golden. When Buffy is restored to life, she undertakes a secret mission with Angel, and all the loose ends are tied up with Buffy’s trip to hell, bringing an end to an amazing four-year run of Buffy comics.* The Buffy Omnibus books collect the earliest Buffy comics and are an excellent precursor to Joss Whedon’s Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight series.   * “There’s plenty of humor and action here. Lots of strange (and strangely fun) violence. And, for Slayer fans, Omnibus is an opportunity to run down memory lane and relive those early, exciting Slayer days.” &amp;mdash; comicbookbin.com</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Graphic Novels & Manga</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Various</author>\\n<published>May 17, 2005 </published>\\n<page_num> 408 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781621151838</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/242269/buffy-omnibus-volume-7-by-tom-fassbender-various-artists/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

From the sleek ships of the glimmering Coruscant skyscape to the lush gardens of pastoral Naboo, dissent is roiling. The Republic is failing, even under the leadership of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, elected ten years earlier to save the crumbling government. Separatists threaten war, and the Senate is hopelessly divided, unable to determine whether to raise an army for battle or keep the fragile peace. It is a stalemate that once broken, could lead to galactic chaos.Mischievous and resolved, courageous to the point of recklessness, Anakin Skywalker has come of age in a time of great upheaval. The nineteen-year-old apprentice to Obi-Wan Kenobi is an enigma to the Jedi Council, and a challenge to his Jedi Master. Time has not dulled Anakin’s ambition, nor has his Jedi training tamed his independent streak. When an attempt on Senator Padmé Amidala’s life brings them together for the first time in ten years, it is clear that time also has not dulled Anakin’s intense feelings for the beautiful diplomat.The attack on Senator Amidala just before a crucial vote thrusts the Republic even closer to the edge of disaster. Masters Yoda and Mace Windu sense enormous unease. The dark side is growing, clouding the Jedi’s perception of the events. Unbeknownst to the Jedi, a slow rumble is building into the roar of thousands of soldiers readying for battle. But even as the Republic falters around them, Anakin and Padmé find a connection so intense that all else begins to fall away. Anakin will lose himself—and his way—in emotions a Jedi, sworn to hold allegiance only to the Order, is forbidden to have.Based on the story by George Lucas and the screenplay by George Lucas and Jonathan Hales, this intense and revealing novel by bestselling author R. A.

In this classic tale, a woman is reunited with the man she has loved for years—and must reveal the secret that will jeopardize her chance for happiness at last. He arrived out of the blue—a flesh-and-blood phantom from the past in a sports car as sleek and sexy as Law Kincaid himself. The world-famous astronaut was as devastatingly attractive as the first time Marnie Hibbs had laid eyes on him, seventeen years before. But she well knew the perils of falling for a ladies’ man like Law. And this time she had someone besides herself to protect. Law is determined to discover who is sending him anonymous letters claiming he’d fathered a son he knows nothing about. Showing up at the Hibbs’s return address from the letters seemed like a step in the right direction. Marnie swears she isn’t the guilty party, but when Law meets her son, it’s like a one-two punch to his solar plexus. The boy is nearly the spitting image of Law. Law can’t remember sleeping with Marnie—then again, he can’t remember much about his crazy past. But there’s more to it than that: Marnie claims the boy isn’t biologically hers. As the tension between them becomes unbearable and the attraction undeniable, Marnie is forced to reveal a long-held secret…one that might cause her to lose both the boy she loves more than anyone—and the man she desires more than anything.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Suspense Romance</d2><d2>Contemporary Romance</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Romance</d1><d1>Women’s Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Sandra Brown</author>\\n<published>Aug 29, 2006 </published>\\n<page_num> 208 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780553589351</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/20029/long-time-coming-by-sandra-brown/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Wark builds on their work to map the historical stages of the society of the spectacle, from the diffuse to the integrated to what he calls the disintegrating spectacle. The Spectacle of Disintegration takes the reader through the critique of political aesthetics of former Situationist T.J. Clark, the Fourierist utopia of Raoul Vaneigem, René Vienet’s earthy situationist cinema, Gianfranco Sangunetti’s pranking of the Italian ruling class, Alice-Becker Ho’s account of the anonymous language of the Romany, Guy Debord’s late films and his surprising work as a game designer.At once an extraordinary counter history of radical praxis and a call to arms in the age of financial crisis and the resurgence of the streets, The Spectacle of Disintegration recalls the hidden journeys taken in the attempt to leave the twentieth century, and plots an exit from the twenty first.The dustjacket unfolds to reveal a fold-out poster of the collaborative graphic essay combining text selected by McKenzie Wark with composition and drawings by Kevin C.

This year marks the tenth anniversary of the attacks on the  World Trade Center and the Pentagon, an occasion that is sure to  be observed around the world. But among the memorials, political  speeches, and news editorials, the most pressing consideration-  and often the most overlooked-is the lives and well-being of the  9/11 first responders, their families, and the victims’ families over  the past decade.Dennis Smith, a former firefighter and the author of the  bestselling Report from Ground Zero, addresses this important  topic in a series of interviews with the heroes and families of those  most affected by the tragedy either through feats of bravery in the  rescue efforts or heroic bearing up in the face of unimaginable loss.  Smith provides an intimate look at a terrible moment in history and its  challenging and difficult aftermath, allowing these survivors to share  their stories of loss, endurance, and resilience in their own words.  A Decade of Hope is an honest and vitally important look at a  decade in the lives of those for whom a national tragedy was a  devastatingly personal ordeal.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>U.S. History</d2><d3>21st Century U.S. History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Dennis Smith</author>\\n<published>Aug 23, 2011 </published>\\n<page_num> 384 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781101543511</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/309247/a-decade-of-hope-by-dennis-smith/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

In Patrimony, fans will  learn more about their favorite redhead–with emerald eyes, uncanny powers, and a  poisonous minidrag–than they ever dreamed possible. “I know who your father is .  . . Gestalt.” A shocked Flinx hears these dying words from one of the renegade eugenicists  whose experiments with humans twenty-odd years ago shocked the galaxy . . . and spawned  Flinx. So Flinx and his minidrag, Pip, venture to Gestalt, an out-of-the-way planet  perfect for someone who never wants to be found–disregarding the advice of those  who think Flinx could make better use of his time locating the ancient, sentient  weapons platform that could be the galaxy’s only chance of stopping the exterminating  scourge that’s fast approaching. Flinx might agree with them–but the quest for patrimony  wins out. (Sorry, galaxy!) Could Gestalt supply the key to Flinx’s shadowy past and  strange powers? An eccentric loner in a remote area could be the father Flinx has  never stopped searching for, perhaps the only person who can unravel the mystery  of his birth and his amazing, agonizing powers. An eccentric longer in a remote area  of the distant planet could be he father Flinx has never stopped searching for, perhaps  the only person who can unravel the mystery of Flinx’s birth and his amazing, agonizing  powers. Unfortunately for Flinx, Gestalt also hosts a resident bounty hunter who’ s just learned about the stupendous reward offered for a certain dead redhead. Flinx  gets a chance to test his adversary’s skills when our hero’s skimmer is blasted out  of the sky and into a raging river in the middle of nowhere–a nowhere of impassable  terrain and ravenous, carnivorous beasts.  But hey, what’s one more impossible challenge  for someone who’s spent his life defying the odds and escaping the inescapable? Flinx  has one thing going for him . . . plenty of experience.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Space Opera</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Science Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Alan Dean Foster</author>\\n<published>Sep 30, 2008 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780345485083</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/54888/patrimony-by-alan-dean-foster/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Alarmist, hateful rhetoric once relegated to the fringes of political discourse has now become frighteningly mainstream, with pundits and politicians routinely invoking the specter of Islam as a menacing, deeply anti-American force.\\xa0In Sacred Ground, author and renowned interfaith leader Eboo Patel says this prejudice is not just a problem for Muslims but a challenge to the very idea of America. Patel shows us that Americans from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. have been “interfaith leaders,” illustrating how the forces of pluralism in America have time and again defeated the forces of prejudice. And now a new generation needs to rise up and confront the anti-Muslim prejudice of our era. To this end, Patel offers a primer in the art and science of interfaith work, bringing to life the growing body of research on how faith can be a bridge of cooperation rather than a barrier of division and sharing stories from the frontlines of interfaith activism. \\xa0Patel asks us to share in his vision of a better America—a robustly pluralistic country in which our commonalities are more important than our differences, and in which difference enriches, rather than threatens, our religious traditions. Pluralism, Patel boldly argues, is at the heart of the American project, and this visionary book will inspire Americans of all faiths to make this country a place where diverse traditions can thrive side by side.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Eboo Patel</author>\\n<published>Sep 03, 2013 </published>\\n<page_num> 224 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780807077528</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/216554/sacred-ground-by-eboo-patel/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

And as another hot Christmas approaches in San Francisco, Robert Grogan and Slatts Calhoun are about to make the street after a stretch in San Quentin. On the inside Robert and Slatts were inmates and lovers, but Robert has a young wife and a daughter on the outside and they’re probably not going to be thrilled about sharing him with Slatts. Trouble waits for them in the whitened winter sunlight of the city.Bleak and magical, afflicted with winos, yuppies, lawyers, tourists, parole officers, drug dealers, and cops, Soon the Rest Will Fall tells a tale of blight, recidivism, and transcendent love.

The appeal of cooking food slowly is undeniable; a moderate oven temperature and extended cooking time can build rich, concentrated flavor and yield tender, juicy meat. But when most of us think of dishes that are slow cooking by nature – such as roasts, braises, and stews – we think of an all-day affair requiring constant attention, something to prepare for a special occasion or when you can commit a full day to the task. But in fact, in many cases just the opposite is true. These dishes are, for the most part, easy – although they take time, the process is largely unattended, leaving you free to simply walk away. You’ll find all the classic slow-cooked dishes here – dishes where time, slow simmering, and gentle heat work their magic.

To the inhabitants of the Jovian moons, Galileo is a revered figure whose actions will influence the subsequent history of the human race.

And if that means Galileo must be burned at the stake, so be it.

Levine draws on his broad experience as a clinician, a student of comparative brain research, a stress scientist and a keen observer of the naturalistic animal world to explain the nature and transformation of trauma in the body, brain and psyche. In an Unspoken Voice is based on the idea that trauma is neither a disease nor a disorder, but rather an injury caused by fright, helplessness and loss that can be healed by engaging our innate capacity to self-regulate high states of arousal and intense emotions. Enriched with a coherent theoretical framework and compelling case examples, the book elegantly blends the latest findings in biology, neuroscience and body-oriented psychotherapy to show that when we bring together animal instinct and reason, we can become more whole human beings.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Personal Growth</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Self-Improvement</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Peter A.

They’re all about preserving local “character,” protecting the natural environment, an dmaintaining attractive neighborhoods. Right?\\xa0In this bold challenge to conventional wisdom, Lisa Prevost strips away the quaint façades of these desirable towns to reveal the uglier impulses behind their proud allegiance to local control. These eye-opening stories illustrate the outrageous lengths to which town leaders and affluent residents will go to prohibit housing that might attract the “wrong” sort of people. Prevost takes readers to a rural second-home community that is so restrictive that its celebrity residents may soon outnumber its children, to a struggling fishing village as it rises up against farmworker housing open to Latino immigrants, and to a northern lake community that brazenly deems itself out of bounds to apartment dwellers. From the blueberry barrens of Down East to the Gold Coast of Connecticut, these stories show how communities have seemingly cast aside the all-American credo of “opportunity for all” in favor of “I was here first.” \\xa0 Prevost links this “every town for itself” mentality to a host of regional afflictions, including a shrinking population of young adults, ugly sprawl, unbearable highway congestion, and widening disparities in income and educational achievement. Snob Zones warns that this pattern of exclusion is unsustainable and raises thought-provoking questions about what it means to be a community in post-recession America.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Domestic Politics</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Politics</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Lisa Prevost</author>\\n<published>Jul 14, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 206 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780807033296</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/221028/snob-zones-by-lisa-prevost/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

As the burgeoning rebellion reaches the palace gates, Marie Antoinette finds her privileged and peaceful life swiftly upended by violence. Once her loyal subjects, the people of France now seek to overthrow the crown, placing the heirs of the Bourbon dynasty in mortal peril. \\xa0 Displaced to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, the royal family is propelled into the heart of the Revolution.

It tells the story of two orphan sisters, Caroline and Grace Bell, as they leave Australia to start a new life in post-war England. What happens to these young women–seduction and abandonment, marriage and widowhood, love and betrayal–becomes as moving and wonderful and yet as predestined as the transits of the planets themselves. Gorgeously written and intricately constructed, Hazzard’s novel is a story of place: Sydney, London, New York, Stockholm; of time: from the fifties to the eighties; and above all, of women and men in their passage through the displacements and absurdities of modern life.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Literary Fiction</d1><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Shirley Hazzard</author>\\n<published>Sep 01, 1990 </published>\\n<page_num> 352 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780140107470</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/321650/the-transit-of-venus-by-shirley-hazzard/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Alexander Sylvester Bracken, Duke of Bedford, has a mission: sail to the Mediterranean and track down Lady Hestia Cary’s missing father. It is a straightforward task, but for two rather vexing complications. First, the sea holds painful memories; second, for her own safety, Hestia is to accompany him. As Alex battles the demons of his past, he must also resist Hestia’s surprisingly skillful attempts at seduction. After all, Alex has sworn to leave her untouched, and he intends to honor that vow—until he can properly ask the Earl’s blessing. Ever since His Grace rescued Hestia from the arms of a Turkish pirate six long years ago, her heart has belonged to Alex. So when he agrees to help find her father, Hestia is thrilled. Although Alex tries to hide it, there’s passion in his eyes—and a frisson of desire in the air—whenever they meet. On board ship, miles from home, Alex won’t be able to deny her any longer. But with scoundrels lying in wait, she may not live to tell the tale of her conquest.Look for the enchanting Disgraced Lords series from Bronwen Evans: A KISS OF LIES | A PROMISE OF MORE | A TOUCH OF PASSION | A WHISPER OF DESIRE | A TASTE OF SEDUCTION | A NIGHT OF FOREVER \\xa0 And don’t miss her novels in the Imperfect Lords series: ADDICTED TO THE DUKE | DRAWN TO THE MARQUESSPraise for Addicted to the Duke“Regency romance fans looking for something just a bit different will adore this one from [Bronwen] Evans.”—Library Journal“I would happily recommend this book and am looking forward to the next installment!”—Flippin’ Pages Book Review Blog \\xa0 “No stranger to adventure, Ms. Evans knows how to thrill readers with her courageous heroes and tempting heroines.

       " '<book date=\"2018-08-18\" xml:lang=\"en\"> \\n<title>High Society</title>\\n<body>Drawing on his unprecedented access to Grace Kelly, bestselling biographer Donald Spoto at last offers an intimate, honest, and authoritative portrait of one of Hollywood’s legendary actresses.In just seven years–from 1950 through 1956–Grace Kelly embarked on a whirlwind career that included roles in eleven movies. From the principled Amy Fowler Kane in High Noon to the thrill-seeking Frances Stevens of To Catch a Thief, Grace established herself as one of Hollywood’s most talented actresses and iconic beauties. Her astonishing career lasted until her retirement at age twenty-six, when she withdrew from stage and screen to marry a European monarch and became a modern, working princess and mother. Based on never-before-published or quoted interviews with Grace and those conducted over many years with her friends and colleagues–from costars James Stewart and Cary Grant to director Alfred Hitchcock–as well as many documents disclosed by her children for the first time, acclaimed biographer Donald Spoto explores the transformation of a convent schoolgirl to New York model, successful television actress, Oscar-winning movie star, and beloved royal. As the princess requested, Spoto waited twenty-five years after her death to write this biography. Now, with honesty and insight, High Society reveals the truth of Grace Kelly’s personal life, the men she loved, the men she didn’t, and what lay behind the façade of her fairy-tale life.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Arts & Entertainment Biographies & Memoirs</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Donald Spoto</author>\\n<published>Oct 05, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 336 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307395627</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/171308/high-society-by-donald-spoto/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

To meet this need, Barnes proposes to give every American a share of the wealth we own together— starting with our air and financial infrastructure.

She shares stories of her childhood in eastern Tennessee as the only child of the dean at the local college—including her first inkling of the power and comfort of prayer and her realization that prayer required a disciplined routine, that it is \"best practiced by a composed mind and spirit.\" She writes of the sense of freedom and independence she discovered at college, where she fell in love with the language and the teachings of The Book of Common Prayer and decided to leave the Presbyterianism of her childhood and join the Episcopal Church. As Tickle chronicles her deepening understanding of prayer and the rewards of marriage, family, and a spiritual life, she reaches across the boundaries that separate one denomination from another and presents a portrait of spiritual growth and transformation that will appeal to devout practitioners and their less religious neighbors as well. Within a very personal story, Tickle reveals the keys that will help readers of all faiths find the path that leads from the everyday world of \"doing\" to the special place of simply \"being.\"From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d2>Philosophy</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Phyllis Tickle</author>\\n<published>Mar 25, 2009 </published>\\n<page_num> 400 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307553102</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/178763/the-shaping-of-a-life-by-phyllis-tickle/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

No one sins out of duty. We sin because it offers  some promise of happiness. That promise enslaves us, until we believe that God is  more desirable than life itself (Psalm 63:3). Only the power of God’s superior promises  in the gospel can emancipate our hearts from servitude to the shallow promises and  fleeting pleasures of sin. Delighting in the bounty of God’s glorious gospel  promises will free us for a less sin-encumbered life, to the glory of Christ.

Japanese forces numbering some 600,000 men began landing in January 1942, determined to seize the island as a cornerstone of the Empire’s strategy to knock Australia out of the war. Allied Commander-in-Chief General Douglas MacArthur committed 340,000 Americans, as well as tens of thousands of Australian, Dutch, and New Guinea troops, to retake New Guinea at all costs.What followed was a four-year campaign that involved some of the most horrific warfare in history. At first emboldened by easy victories throughout the Pacific, the Japanese soon encountered in New Guinea a roadblock akin to the Germans’ disastrous attempt to take Moscow, a catastrophic setback to their war machine. For the Americans, victory in New Guinea was the first essential step in the long march towards the Japanese home islands and the ultimate destruction of Hirohito’s empire. Winning the war in New Guinea was of critical importance to MacArthur. His avowed “I shall return” to the Philippines could only be accomplished after taking the island.In this gripping narrative, historian James P. Duffy chronicles the most ruthless combat of the Pacific War, a fight complicated by rampant tropical disease, violent rainstorms, and unforgiving terrain that punished both Axis and Allied forces alike. Drawing on primary sources, War at the End of the World fills in a crucial gap in the history of World War II while offering readers a narrative of the first rank.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Military History</d2><d2>World History</d2><d3>World War II Military History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>James P.

By urging us to work toward equality of opportunity for all, the authors situate health care reform among the larger social problems we must face.The authors’ argument for reform in early childhood development, nutrition, work environment, and distribution of income is certain to spark debate.

In this nineteenth-century classic of freethought literature, John E. Remsberg reveals that while there may be some historical evidence for the existence of a man named Jesus, the supernatural “Christ” of Christian dogma could not have existed.Using the tools of textual criticism and applying rigorous logical analysis, Remsberg carefully examines the New Testament Scriptures, the writings of well-known pagan authors from the time of Jesus as well as the works of later Christian apologists, he finds precious little evidence for the supposed miracles worked by Jesus, or even for his birth, ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection. His conclusion is that the divine, miracle-working Christ of traditional Christianity is a myth, which was developed over many centuries by a community of believers and was heavily influenced by mythic elements of Greek, Roman, and eastern religions. Remsberg concludes this interesting and thorough study with a detailed discussion of the various ancient sources from which the Christ myth evolved. The Christ is both an excellent introduction to biblical criticism and a valuable contribution to freethought.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Religion</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Religion & Philosophy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>John E.

The  instigator of this war is the Colony, a race of intelligent ants who,  for thousands of years, have been silently building an army that would  forever eradicate the destructive, oppressive humans. Under the Colony’s  watchful eye, this utopia will be free of the humans’ penchant for  violence, exploitation and religious superstition. As a final step in the war effort, the Colony uses its strange technology to transform the surface animals into high-functioning two-legged beings who rise up to kill their masters. Former housecat turned war hero, Mort(e) is famous for taking on the  most dangerous missions and fighting the dreaded human bio-weapon EMSAH.  But the true motivation behind his recklessness is his ongoing search  for a pre-transformation friend—a dog named Sheba. When he receives a  mysterious message from the dwindling human resistance claiming Sheba is  alive, he begins a journey that will take him from the remaining human  strongholds to the heart of the Colony, where he will discover the  source of EMSAH and the ultimate fate of all of earth’s creatures.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Epic Fantasy</d2><d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Fantasy</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Robert Repino</author>\\n<published>Feb 09, 2016 </published>\\n<page_num> 384 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781616956219</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/238084/morte-by-robert-repino/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

He entered kindergarten the year that the Brown v. Board of Education decision led to integrated schools, allowing blacks and whites to learn side by side. A week after Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, Wallace enrolled in high school and his sensational jumping, dunking, and rebounding abilities quickly earned him the attention of college basketball recruiters from top schools across the nation. In his senior year his Pearl High School basketball team won Tennessee’s first racially-integrated state tournament.The world seemed to be opening up at just the right time, and when Vanderbilt University recruited Wallace to play basketball, he courageously accepted the assignment to desegregate the Southeastern Conference. The hateful experiences he would endure on campus and in the hostile gymnasiums of the Deep South turned out to be the stuff of nightmares. Yet Wallace persisted, endured, and met this unthinkable challenge head on. This insightful biography digs deep beneath the surface to reveal a complicated, profound, and inspiring story of an athlete turned civil rights trailblazer.Praise for Strong Inside★\\xa0”This moving biography is thought-provoking, riveting and heart-wrenching, though it remains hopeful as it takes readers into the midst of the basketball and civil rights action.”—Booklist, STARRED review“This portrait of the fortitude of a young athlete will make a huge impact on teens and is guaranteed to spark serious discussion.”—School Library Journal“Even if you’re not a history buff, this important story is worth your time.”—Sports Illustrated Kids“A fascinating, very personal account of the effect that the civil rights movement had on one individual. . .\\xa0a must purchase for any middle school or high school library.”—Miss Yingling Reads</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Children’s Books</d0><d1>Children’s Middle Grade Books</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Andrew Maraniss</author>\\n<published>Dec 26, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 272 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781524737276</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546842/strong-inside-young-readers-edition-by-andrew-maraniss/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Here, the Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan, stalked by enemies seen  and unseen and plagued by a divided family, leads a sprawling force of horsemen beyond  the realm of their known world. He will bring a storm to Arab lands and face the  armies of the shah in all their strength. From the fierce cold plains of Mongolia  to the Korean Peninsula, Genghis’s brothers, sons, and commanders have made emperors  bow, slaughtering vast armies of fighting men. But as Genghis enters a strange new  land of towering mountains and arid desert, he stirs an enemy greater than any he  has met before. Under his command, Shah Ala-ud-Din Mohammed has thousands of fierce  Arab warriors, teeming cavalry, and terrifying armored elephants. When Genghis strikes,  the Arabs prove their mettle. On the verge of defeat, Genghis is forced to leave  his own vast encampment, and the women and children in it, in the path of an enraged,  savage enemy. While the Mongols—men, women, and children—fight back, as secret assassins  are sent into the night, another battle is taking shape. Two of Genghis’s sons, Jochi  and Chagatai, are steeped in enmity. Warriors choose between them, and a murderer  commits an unspeakable crime. Soon the most powerful man in the world, who has brought  devastation to this land, must choose a successor. And when he does, it will touch  off the most bitter conflict of all. In a novel that ranges from the fertile lands  of the Chin to the dust and rock of Afghanistan, Conn Iggulden weaves the epic story  of history’s most enigmatic conqueror —those who feared him, those who defied him,  and those whose bones he left behind.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Fiction</d0><d1>Historical Fiction</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Conn Iggulden</author>\\n<published>Jul 13, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 432 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780385342803</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/85012/genghis-bones-of-the-hills-by-conn-iggulden/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

This, he says, is the great issue of our time–the most important missing piece in the building of Canada. The events that began late in 2012 with the Idle No More movement were not just a rough patch in Aboriginal relations with the rest of Canada. What is happening today between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals is not about guilt or sympathy or failure or romanticization of the past. It is about citizens’ rights. It is about rebuilding relationships that were central to the creation of Canada. These relationships are just as important to its continued existence. The centrality of Aboriginal issues and peoples has the potential to open up a more creative way of imagining ourselves and a more honest narrative for Canada.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Wide in scope but piercing in detail, The Comeback presents a powerful portrait of modern Aboriginal life in Canada illustrated by a remarkable selection of letters, speeches, and writings by Aboriginal leaders and thinkers, showcasing the extraordinarily rich, moving, and stable indigenous point of view across the centuries.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>World History</d2><d2>U.S. History</d2><d3>North American World History</d3><d3>Native American History</d3><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>History</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>John Ralston Saul</author>\\n<published>Aug 25, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 304 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780143192725</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/417490/the-comeback-by-john-ralston-saul/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Everything she had conquered, with blood, sweat, tears, and smiles, hap¬pened, as she said, with God leading her by the hand. However her life, her dreams, and the joy she shared with so many came to a tragic end just before dawn on December 9, 2012.In Jenni Rivera: The Incredible Story of a Warrior Butterfly, Leila Cobo—pianist, TV host, and Executive Director for Latino content and programming at Billboard—brings us Jenni Rivera’s intimate and moving biography, reflecting on the party girl, the elegant woman, the great diva, the friend, the mother, and the grandmother.

Crease in this engaging exploration of history’s most beautiful experiments. The result is an engrossing journey through nearly 2,500 years of scientific innovation. Along the way, we encounter glimpses into the personalities and creative thinking of some of the field’s most interesting figures.We see the first measurement of the earth’s circumference, accomplished in the third century B.C. by Eratosthenes using sticks, shadows, and simple geometry. We visit Foucault’s mesmerizing pendulum, a cannonball suspended from the dome of the Panthéon in Paris that allows us to see the rotation of the earth on its axis. We meet Galileo—the only scientist with two experiments in the top ten—brilliantly drawing on his musical training to measure the speed of falling bodies. And we travel to the quantum world, in the most beautiful experiment of all.We also learn why these ten experiments exert such a powerful hold on our imaginations. From the ancient world to cutting-edge physics, these ten exhilarating moments reveal something fundamental about the world, pulling us out of confusion and revealing nature’s elegance.

We meet Franklin, a parrot with a wicked sense of humor; R.C., a courageous Doberman who defined loyalty and sacrifice; Suzie Q, the horse who taught Brown the meaning of hard work; and of course the beloved and prolific Sneaky Pie, who needs no introduction to her legions of fans.

Howard, creator of Conan the Cimmerian, continues with this latest compendium of Howard’s fiction and poetry. These adventures, set in medieval-era Europe and the Near East, are among the most gripping Howard ever wrote, full of pageantry, romance, and battle scenes worthy of Tolstoy himself. Most of all, they feature some of Howard’s most unusual and memorable characters, including Cormac FitzGeoffrey, a half-Irish, half-Norman man of war who follows Richard the Lion-hearted to twelfth-century Palestine—or, as it was known to the Crusaders, Outremer; Diego de Guzman, a Spaniard who visits Cairo in the guise of a Muslim on a mission of revenge; and the legendary sword woman Dark Agnès, who, faced with an arranged marriage to a brutal husband in sixteenth-century France, cuts the ceremony short with a dagger thrust and flees to forge a new identity on the battlefield.Lavishly illustrated by award-winning artist John Watkiss and featuring miscellanea, informative essays, and a fascinating introduction by acclaimed historical author Scott Oden, Sword Woman and Other Historical Adventures is a must-have for every fan of Robert E.

Extension of grace is rare and demands a conscious choice. Yet if we are to obey Christ’s teachings and follow his example, we must be willing to consistently forgive those in our lives who seem the least forgivable. We must commit not just to granting the occasional pardon, but to totally embracing a lifestyle of forgiveness. Through practical, everyday examples, Forgive One Another reveals how you can work through bitterness and betrayal and come to a place where you habitually, persistently, and lovingly offer compassion and forgiveness, as Christ commands. LEARN HOW TO FORGIVE THE UNFORGIVABLE.

A multiple Grammy Award-winning composer, pianist, and singer with an inimitable vocal style and a catalog of hits including “What I Say,” “Georgia on My Mind,” “Unchain My Heart,” “I Can’t Stop Loving You,” and “America the Beautiful,” Ray Charles’s music is loved by fans around the world.Now his eldest son, Ray Charles Robinson Jr., shares an intimate glimpse of the man behind the music, with never-before-told stories. Going beyond the fame, the concerts, and the tours, Ray Jr. opens the doors of his family home and reveals their private lives with fondness and frankness.He shares his father’s grief and guilt over his little brother’s death at the age of five — as well of moments of personal joy, like watching his father run his hands over the Christmas presents under their tree while singing softly to himself. He tells of how Ray overcame the challenges of being blind, even driving cars, riding a Vespa, and flying his own plane. And, in gripping detail, he reveals how as a six-year-old boy he saved his father’s life one harrowing night.Ray Jr. writes honestly about the painful facts of the addiction that nearly destroyed his father’s life. His father’s struggles with heroin addiction, his arrests, and how he ultimately kicked the drug cold turkey are presented in unflinching detail. Ray Jr. also shares openly about how, as an adult, he fell victim to the same temptations that plagued his father.He paints a compassionate portrait of his mother, Della, whose amazing voice as a gospel singer first attracted Ray Charles. Though her husband’s drug use, his womanizing, and the paternity suits leveled against him constantly threatened the stability of the Robinson home, Della exhibited incredible resilience and inner strength.Told with deep love and fearless candor, You Don’t Know Me is the powerful and poignant story of the Ray Charles the public never saw — the father and husband and fascinating human being who also happened to be one of the greatest musicians of all time.From the Hardcover edition.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Biography & Memoir</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ray Charles Robinson, Jr., Mary Jane Ross</author>\\n<published>Jun 08, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 288 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780307462954</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/26290/you-dont-know-me-by-ray-charles-robinson-jr-with-mary-jane-ross/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to Think Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge.You’ll also learn how to:–Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve–Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries–Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job–Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory–Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problemsAlthough the book’s examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative art—and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Technology</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Popular Science</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>V.

The trouble begins when Harry’s dear friend Miranda Hogendobber takes her on a leisurely drive that ends in a narrow drainage ditch. The chaos continues when the Very Reverend Herbert Jones’s Chevy pickup also abruptly goes kaput. But these vehicular mishaps are nothing compared to the much more distressing state of a mechanic discovered by Harry in a local repair shop: His head’s been bashed in. Despite numerous warnings from her much-loved coterie of friends, human and otherwise, Harry quickly surmises that the time has come to pop the hood and conduct her own investigation. Her animal companions see disaster fast approaching but can do little except try their best to protect their foolishly intrepid human. Harry’s race to the truth leads straight to powerful forces determined to avoid scrutiny at any cost—even if it means running Harry Haristeen off the road for good. \\xa0Includes a preview of Rita Mae Brown and Sneaky Pie Brown’s next Mrs. Murphy mystery, The Litter of the Law“Harry and her pals are on the case. . . .

A concert pianist on the London scene, his career is upended when the train he is travelling on crashes into the wall at the end of a tunnel. The accident splinters his left wrist, jeopardizing his musical ambitions. On a whim, he uses his compensation pay-out to buy a house he has seen only once in a newspaper photograph, a replica of Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye on a stretch of coast outside Cape Town. Together with his wife, Mim, Mr. Field sets out in the hope that the house will make him happier, or at least less unhappy.\\xa0But as time passes, the house—which Le Corbusier designed as “a machine for living”—begins to have a disturbing effect on Mr. Field. Its narrow windows educate him in the pleasures of frustrated desire. Its sequence of spaces, which seem to lead toward and away from their destinations at once, mirror his sense of being increasingly cut off from the world and from other people. When his wife inexplicably leaves him, Mr. Field can barely summon the will to search for her. Alone in the decaying house, he finds himself unglued from reality and possessed by a longing for a perverse kind of intimacy. OK, Mr. Field is a strange and beguiling novel that dwells in the silences between words, in the gaps in conversation, and in the unbridgeable distance between any two people.

It’s time to unlock the pantry and break free from the shackles of ready-made, industrial food. It’s time to cook supper. The Lost Art of Real Cooking heralds a new old-fashioned approach to food-laborious and inconvenient, yet extraordinarily rewarding and worth bragging about. From jam, yogurt, and fresh pasta to salami, smoked meat, and strudel, Ken Albala and Rosanna Nafziger arm you with the knowledge and skills that let you connect on a deeper level with what goes into your body.Ken and Rosanna celebrate the patience it takes to make your own sauerkraut and pickles. They divulge the mysteries of capturing wild sourdoughs and culturing butter, the beauty of rendering lard, making cheese, and brewing beer, all without the fancy toys that take away from the adventure of truly experiencing your food.These foods were once made by the family, in the home, rather than a factory. And they can still be made in the smallest kitchens without expensive equipment, capturing flavors that speak of place and personality. What you won’t find here is a collection of rigid rules for the perfect meal. Ken and Rosanna offer a wealth of recipes, history, and techniques that start with the basics and evolve into dishes that are entirely your own.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Cooking Methods</d2><d2>Regional & Ethnic Cooking</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Cooking</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Ken Albala, Rosanna Nafziger Henderson</author>\\n<published>Jul 06, 2010 </published>\\n<page_num> 256 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781101188712</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/305484/the-lost-art-of-real-cooking-by-ken-albala/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

But stick with me here and\\xa0see how it leads you upward. You’ll understand why\\xa0great leaders embrace ignorance and use it to elevate\\xa0their people to new heights of achievement.”A conductor in front of his orchestra\\xa0is an iconic symbol of leadership—but what does a\\xa0true maestro actually do to enable the right sort of\\xa0cooperation among his players, leading to an excellent\\xa0performance? If you think his primary job is making\\xa0sure the musicians play the right notes, prepare to be\\xa0surprised.For twenty years, in addition to conducting orchestras\\xa0around the world, Itay Talgam has been a “conductor\\xa0of people” for companies large and small, for\\xa0CEOs of Fortune 500 companies as well as startup\\xa0entrepreneurs, and beyond. Drawing on his decades of\\xa0experience on the podium, he teaches nonmusicians\\xa0how conducting really works and how the conductor’s\\xa0art can help leaders in any field.In his lectures (including an acclaimed TED talk)\\xa0and now in this book, Talgam shows why imposing\\xa0your vision on your people is likely to backfire. Great\\xa0conductors may know in advance how they want a\\xa0piece to be played, but they make room for the creativity\\xa0and passion of their musicians. They respect the\\xa0gap between the baton and the instruments. They\\xa0focus more on listening than on speaking. And they\\xa0embrace their own ignorance, knowing that others\\xa0may have better ideas than the conductor can imagine.Talgam explores the nuances of leadership by\\xa0describing the distinctive styles of six world-famous\\xa0conductors: the commanding Riccardo Muti, the\\xa0fatherly and passionate Arturo Toscanini, the calm\\xa0Richard Strauss, the gurulike Herbert von Karajan,\\xa0the dancing Carlos Kleiber, and the master of dialogue\\xa0Leonard Bernstein. All took different approaches to\\xa0the age-old leadership dilemma: how to maximize\\xa0both control and creative freedom at the same time.The Ignorant Maestro will empower you to help\\xa0your own team make even more beautiful music.\\xa0Talgam’s anecdotes and insights will change the way\\xa0you think about listening, humility, and the path to\\xa0unpredictable brilliance.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Music</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Arts & Entertainment</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Itay Talgam</author>\\n<published>May 19, 2015 </published>\\n<page_num> 240 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781591847236</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316154/the-ignorant-maestro-by-itay-talgam/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

An earnest young academic, Daniel has come for a summer job cataloguing a private collector’s library.  But when Daniel’s employer sends him to buy a stolen violin from a petty thief, a chain reaction of violence and deception ignites.   Suddenly Daniel is drawn into a police investigation—and a tempest swirling around a beautiful woman, a mysterious palazzo, and a lost musical masterpiece dating back centuries. With each step he takes, Daniel unwittingly retraces a journey that began in 1733, when another young man came to Venice.

Separated by centuries, two tales of passion, betrayal, and danger collide in David Hewson’s dazzling novel.

The book is well organized in 5 major sections. There is a very thorough overview of the precepts and tenets of the practice, its historical origins, a detailed and well-covered biography of Samuel Hahnemann and a review of the politics of the allopathy v. homeopathy debate. It is further embellished with copious annotations, an appendix with an actual case history and a very fine reference for homeopathic resources such as organizations, suppliers and other texts covering a variety of related topics. Call it a perfect Homeopathy 101 text if you will, the author makes a very even-handed presentation of the material, including the politics of medicine as they have evolved in the USA over the past century.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d2>Alternative Therapies</d2><d0>Nonfiction</d0><d1>Health & Fitness</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Richard Grossinger</author>\\n<published>Aug 14, 1998 </published>\\n<page_num> 192 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9781556432903</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/72350/homeopathy-the-great-riddle-by-richard-grossinger/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",

Things seem somewhat back to normal, until Shelby learns that Anfractus isn’t what it seems. Wascana Park doesn’t take you to another realm; it just shows what’s beneath the surface of this one—and what’s there isn’t pretty.Basilissa Latona is raising a new army, still determined to create her own empire. If she succeeds, both worlds will be in danger.

Sophie Seacove is a storyteller. She tells stories of what the world would be like if madness hadn’t taken over. If her parents hadn’t sold her off as a servant to pay for their passage out of London. If she wasn’t now trapped in a decaying mansion filled with creepy people and surrounded by ravenous sea monsters.The mansion has plenty of stories, too: About fantastical machines, and the tragic inventor who created them. About his highly suspicious death. \\xa0And about the Monster Box, a mysterious object hidden in the house that just might hold the\\xa0key to escaping this horrible place—and to reuniting Sophie with her family.But not everyone wants Sophie to have the Monster Box, and as she gets closer to finding it, she finds herself unspooling years-old secrets—and dodging dangerous attacks. Sophie needs to use her brains, her brawn, and her unbreakable nature if she wants to make it off this wretched island…and live to tell this story.</body>\\n<copyright>(c) Penguin Random House</copyright>\\n<metadata>\\n<topics>\\n<d0>Children’s Books</d0><d1>Children’s Middle Grade Books</d1>\\n</topics>\\n<author>Charlotte Salter</author>\\n<published>Feb 14, 2017 </published>\\n<page_num> 352 Pages</page_num>\\n<isbn>9780399186349</isbn>\\n<url>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/535271/the-bone-snatcher-by-charlotte-salter/</url>\\n</metadata>\\n</book>\\n',\n",
